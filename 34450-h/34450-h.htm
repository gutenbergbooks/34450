<h3>EDITORS' ANNOUNCEMENT</h3>


<p>The rapid increase of specialization makes it impossible
for one author to cover satisfactorily the whole
field of modern Biology. This situation, which exists in
all the sciences, has induced English authors to issue
series of monographs in Biochemistry, Physiology, and
Physics. A number of American biologists have decided
to provide the same opportunity for the study of
Experimental Biology.</p>

<p>Biology, which not long ago was purely descriptive
and speculative, has begun to adopt the methods of the
exact sciences, recognizing that for permanent progress
not only experiments are required but quantitative experiments.
It will be the purpose of this series of monographs
to emphasize and further as much as possible this development
of Biology.</p>

<p>Experimental Biology and General Physiology are one
and the same science, in method as well as content, since
both aim at explaining life from the physico-chemical
constitution of living matter. The series of monographs
on Experimental Biology will therefore include the field
of traditional General Physiology.</p>

<h3><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h3>


<p>Bioluminescence, the production of light by animals
and plants, has always excited the admiration of the layman
and the wonder of the scientist. It is not surprising
that an enormous literature dealing with the subject has
grown up. A large part of this literature, however, is
made up merely of reports that a certain animal is luminous,
or records of especially brilliant phosphorescence of
the sea. Among those who have inquired somewhat more
carefully into the nature and causes of light production
may be mentioned the names of Beijerinck, R. Boyle,
Dahlgren, Dubois, Ehrenberg, Krukenberg, Mangold,
McDermott, Molisch, Panceri, Pfl&#0252;ger, Phipson, Quatrefages,
Spallanzani, and Trojan. Several of these men
have written comprehensive monographs on the subject.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this book to deal with every
phase of bioluminescence. Volumes could be written on
the evolutionary side of the problem and the structure and
uses of luminous organs. These questions can only be
touched upon. Neither is it my purpose to discuss the
ultimate cause of the light, whether due to vibration of
electrons or to other causes. That problem must be left
to the physicist, although it is highly probable that a study
of animal light will give important information regarding
the nature of light in general, and no theory of light can
be adequate which fails to take into account the extraordinary
powers of luminous animals.</p>

<p>We shall be concerned largely with the physical characteristics
of animal light and the chemical processes<!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
underlying its production. Great advances have been
made since the first early guesses that the light was due
to phosphorus and was a kind of oxidation. Although the
problem cannot be considered as solved, it has been placed
on a sound physico-chemical basis. Some material is
oxidized. Exactly what this material is and why light
accompanies its oxidation are the two more fundamental
problems in the field of Bioluminescence. How far and
with what success we have progressed toward a solution
of these problems may be seen from a perusal of the
following pages.</p>

<p>It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the kindness of
Dr. W. E. Forsythe of the Nela Institute, Cleveland, Ohio,
in reading and criticizing the manuscript of <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>,
and of Professor Lyman of Harvard University for a
similar review of <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter II</a>. I am also deeply indebted
to my wife for reading the proof and to Dr. Jacques Loeb
and Prof. W. J. V. Osterhout for many suggestions
throughout the book. My thanks are also due to Prof.
C. Ishikawa of the Agricultural College, Imperial
University of Tokio, Japan, for his generous assistance
in providing <i>Cypridina</i> material. Finally I wish to
acknowledge the support of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, through its director of Marine Biology, Dr.
Alfred G. Mayor. Without this support much of the work
described in this book could not have been accomplished.</p>

<p class="repeat-title">THE
NATURE OF ANIMAL LIGHT</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I
<br />
LIGHT-PRODUCING ORGANISMS</h2>


<p>The fact that animals can produce light must have
been recognized from the earliest times in countries where
fireflies and glowworms abound, but it is only since the
perfection of the microscope that the phosphorescence of
the sea, the light of damp wood and of dead fish and flesh
has been proved to be due to living organisms. Aristotle
mentions the light of dead fish and flesh and both Aristotle
and Pliny that of damp wood. Robert Boyle in 1667 made
many experiments to show that the light from all three
sources, as well as that of the glowworm, is dependent
upon a plentiful supply of air and drew an interesting
comparison between the light of shining wood and that of
a glowing coal. Boyle had no means of finding out the
true cause of the light and early views of its nature were
indeed fantastic. Even as late as 1800 Hulme concludes
from his experiments on phosphorescent fish that the
light is a "constituent principle of marine fishes" and
the "first that escapes after the death of the fish." It
was only in 1830 that Michaelis suspected the light of
dead fish to be the result of some living thing and in
1854 Heller gave the name <i>Sarcina noctiluca</i> to the suspected
organism. In 1875 Pfl&#0252;ger showed that nutrient
media could be inoculated with small amounts of luminous
fish and that these would increase in size, like bacterial<!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
colonies, and we now know that the light of all dead fish
and flesh is due to luminous bacteria.</p>

<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century it was surmised
that the light of damp wood was connected with
fungus growth because of a similarity in smell. In 1854
Heller recognized minute strands, which he called <i>Rhizomorpha
noctiluca</i>, as the actual source of the light. We
now know that all phosphorescent wood is due to the
mycelium of various kinds of fungi and that sometimes the
fruiting body of the fungus also produces light.</p>

<p>The phosphorescence or "burning of the sea," which
is described by so many of the older explorers, is also due
entirely to living organisms, both microscopic and macroscopic.
The latter are mostly jelly-fish (<i>medus&aelig;</i>) or comb
jellies (<i>Ctenophores</i>) and give rise to the larger, more brilliant
flashes of light often seen in the wake or about the
sides of a steamer at night. The former are various
species of dinoflagellates or cystoflagellates such as
<i>Noctiluca</i> (just visible to the naked eye) which collect
at the surface of the sea and often increase in such numbers
that the water is colored by day (usually pink or
red) and shines like a sheet of fire when disturbed at night.
Although <i>Noctiluca</i> was recognized as a luminous animal
in 1753 by Baker, the light of the sea was a mysterious
phenomenon to the older observers. MacCartney, speaking
before the Royal Society in 1810, outlines the various
older theories as follows: "Many writers have ascribed
the light of the sea to other causes than luminous animals.
Martin supposed it to be occasioned by putrefaction;
Silberschlag believed it to be phosphoric; Prof. J. Mayer
conjectured that the surface of the sea imbibed light,
which it afterwards discharged. Bajon and Gentil<!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
thought the light of the sea was electric, because it was
excited by friction.... I shall not trespass on the
time of the Society to refute the above speculations; their
authors have left them unsupported by either arguments
or experiments, and they are inconsistent with all ascertained
facts upon the subject. The remarkable property
of emitting light during life is only met amongst animals
of the four last classes of modern naturalists, viz., mollusca,
insects, worms, and zo&#0246;phytes." MacCartney
recognized the true cause of the light, although he had
little idea of the vast number of marine forms which are
luminous and omits entirely any reference to the fishes,
many of which produce a light of their own when living,
apart from any bacterial infection.</p>

<p>A survey of the animal kingdom discloses at least 36
orders containing one or more forms known to produce
light and several more orders containing species whose
luminosity is doubtful. In the plant kingdom there are
two groups containing luminous forms. The distribution
of luminous organisms is brought out in the <a href="#TABLE_1">accompanying
classification of plants and animals</a>. Those orders are
printed in italics which contain species whose self-luminosity
is fairly well established. It will be noted that
further subdivisions into orders is not given in classes
of animals which lack luminous forms.</p>

<p>The only groups of the plant kingdom which are known
to produce light are some of the bacteria and some of the
fungi and the dinoflagellates (<i>Peridine&aelig;</i>) if one is to
include them among the plants. Many different species
of phosphorescent bacteria have been described, differing
in cultural characteristics and structural peculiarities and
grouped in the genera, <i>Bacterium</i>, <i>Photobacterium</i>, <i>Bacillus</i>,
<i>Microspira</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Micrococcus</i>, and <i>Vibrio</i>.
Specific names indicating their light-producing power
such as <i>phosphorescens</i>, <i>phosphoreum</i>, <i>luminosum</i>, <i>lucifera</i>,
etc., have been applied.</p>

<p>All the fungi which are definitely known to produce
light belong to the <i>Basidiomycetes</i>, the largest
and most highly developed of the true fungi. Either
the mycelium alone or the fruiting body alone, or both,
may be luminescent.</p>

<p>Among animals the best known forms are the dinoflagellates;
<i>Noctiluca</i>; hydroids; jelly-fish; ctenophores;
sea pens; <i>Ch&aelig;topterus</i> and other marine worms; earthworms;
brittle stars; various crustaceans; myriapods;
fireflies and glowworms, the larv&aelig; of fireflies; <i>Pholas
dactylus</i> and <i>Phyllirrho&#0235; bucephala</i>, both molluscs; squid;
<i>Pyrosoma</i>, a colonial ascidian; and fishes.</p>

<p>Luminous animals are all either marine or terrestrial
forms. No examples of fresh water luminous organisms
are known. Of marine forms, the great majority are deep
sea animals, and it is among these that the development
of true luminous organs of a complicated nature is most
pronounced. Many of the luminous marine animals are
to be found in the plankton, while the littoral luminous
forms are in the minority. Some members of all the above
groups are found at one or another of our marine labora<!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>tories
with the possible exception of <i>Pholas</i>, <i>Phyllirrho&#0235;</i>
and squid. Although earthworms and myriapods which
produce light are found in the United States, they are
rather rare and seldom observed forms.</p>

<p>Not only adult forms but the embryos and even the
eggs of some animals are luminous. The egg of <i>Lampyris</i>
emits light within the ovary and freshly laid eggs are
quite luminous. The light does not come from luminous
material of the luminous organ adhering to the egg when
it is laid but from within the egg itself. <i>Pyrophorus</i> eggs
are also luminous. The segmentation stages of <i>Ctenophores</i>
are luminous on stimulation, as noted by Allman
(1862), Agassiz (1874) and Peters (1905), but the eggs
themselves do not luminesce. <i>Schizopod larv&aelig;</i> (Trojan,
1907), <i>Copepod nauplii</i> (Giesbrecht, 1895), <i>Ch&aelig;topterus
larv&aelig;</i> (Enders, 1909), and brittle star <i>plutei</i> (Mangold,
1907) also produce light.</p>

<p>Apparently there is no rhyme or reason in the distribution
of luminescence throughout the plant or animal kingdom.
It is as if the various groups had been written on
a blackboard and a handful of sand cast over the names.
Where each grain of sand strikes, a luminous species
appears. The <i>C&#339;lenterates</i> have received most sand.
Luminescence is more widespread in this phylum and
more characteristic of the group as a whole than any
other. Among the arthropods luminous forms crop up
here and there in widely unrelated groups. In the mollusks,
excluding the cephalopods, only two luminous species
are known. Several <i>phyla</i> contain no luminous forms
whatever. It is an extraordinary fact that one species in
a genus may be luminous and another closely allied species
contain no trace of luminosity. There seems to have been<!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
no development of luminosity along direct evolutionary
lines, although a more or less definite series of gradations
with increasing structural complexity may be traced out
among the forms with highly developed luminous organs.</p>

<p>While the accompanying list of luminous genera aims
to be fairly complete, there are no doubt omissions and
some inaccuracies in it. Anyone who has ever tried to
determine what animal is responsible for the occasional
flashes of light observed on agitating almost any sample
of sea water will realize how difficult it is to discover
the luminous form among a host of non-luminous ones,
especially if the animal is microscopic in size. It is not
surprising, then, to find many false reports of luminous
animals in the literature of the subject and we cannot
be too careful in accepting as luminous a reported case.
The difficulty lies chiefly in the fact that all luminous
organisms with the exception of bacteria, fungi, and a
few fish, flash only on stimulation, and, while it is easy
enough to see the flash, the animal is lost between the
flashes. The only safe way to detect luminous organisms
is to add a little ammonia to the sea water. This slowly
kills the organisms and causes any luminous forms to
glow with a steady, continuous light for some time, a
condition accompanying the death of the animal. Not
all observers, however, have followed this method. One
must always be on guard against confusing the light from
a supposed luminous form with the light from truly
luminous organisms living upon it. The reported cases of
luminosity among marine alg&aelig; are now known to be due
to hydroids or unicellular organisms living on the alga.</p>

<p>We know also that many non-luminous forms may
become infected with luminous bacteria, not only after<!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
death, but also while living, so that their luminescence is
purely secondary. Giard and Billet (1889-90) succeeded
in inoculating many different kinds of amphipod crustacea
(<i>Talitrus</i>, <i>Orchestia</i>, <i>Ligia</i>) and isopod crustacea (<i>Porcellio</i>,
<i>Philoscia</i>) with luminous bacteria, in some cases passing
the infection from one to the next through nine
individuals. Curiously enough the bacterium did not
produce light on artificial culture media but did when
growing in the body of the crustacea, which were killed in
about seven days by the infection. The species of <i>Talitrus</i>
and <i>Orchestia</i> might easily have been taken for truly
luminous animals if not carefully investigated.</p>

<p>Tarchanoff (1901) has injected luminous bacteria into
the dorsal lymph sac of frogs with the result that the
animals continued to glow for three to four days, especially
about the tongue. I remember once while collecting
luminous beetles in Cuba, I was astounded to find a
frog which was luminous. Expecting this animal to be
of great interest, I examined it further only to find that
the frog had just finished a hearty meal of fireflies,
whose light was shining through the belly with considerable
intensity.</p>

<p>Infection with luminous bacteria is especially liable to
occur in any dead marine animal. The flesh is an excellent
culture medium. I have seen non-luminous species of
squid, recently killed, covered with minute growing colonies,
quite evenly spaced, so as to closely resemble luminous
species whose light is restricted to scattered light
organs over the surface of the body.</p>

<p>Indeed Pierantoni (1918) has carried this idea to
extremes. He believes that in the luminous organs of
fireflies, cephalopods and <i>Pyrosoma</i>, luminous symbiotic<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
bacteria occur which are responsible for the light of these
animals, and he claims in the case of cephalopods and
<i>Pyrosoma</i> to have been able to isolate these in pure culture
on artificial culture media. In the firefly they can be seen
but not grown and in luminous animals where no visible
bacteria-like structures are apparent he believes we are
dealing with ultra-microscopic luminous bacteria similar
to the pathogenic forms suspected in filterable viruses.
While the assumption of ultra-microscopic organisms
makes the refutation of Pierantoni's views a somewhat
hazardous task, no one can deny that even an ultra-microscopic
organism will be killed by boiling with 20 per cent.
(by wt.) HCl for 6 hours. As we shall see, the luminous
material of <i>Cypridina</i>, an ostracod crustacean, can withstand
such prolonged boiling with strong acid. The light
of one animal at least, and I believe many others also,
cannot be due to any sort of symbiotic organism.</p>

<p>Apart from these cases where light is actually produced
but is not primary, not produced by the animal
itself, there are many forms whose surface is so constituted
as to produce interference colors. This is true in
many cases among the birds and butterflies whose feathers
and scales are iridescent. Some of these have been erroneously
described as luminous. Perhaps the best known
case among aquatic animals is <i>Sapphirina</i>, a marine copepod
living at the surface of the sea, and especially likely
to be collected with other luminous forms. Its cuticle
is so ruled with fine lines as to diffract the light and flash
on moving much as a fire opal. Needless to say no trace
of light is given off from this animal in a totally dark room.</p>

<p>It has often been supposed that the eye of a cat or
of other animals is luminous. The eyes of a moth, also,<!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
can be seen to glow like beads of fire when it is flying
about a flame. Both of these cases are, however, purely
reflection phenomena and due to reflection out of the eye
again of light which has entered from some external
source. The correct explanation was given by Prevost in
1810. The eye of any animal is quite invisible in absolute
darkness. The same explanation applies to the moss,
<i>Schistostega</i>, which lives in dimly illuminated places and
whose cells are almost spherical, constructed like a lens,
so as to refract the light and condense it on the chloroplasts
at the bottom of the cells. Some of this light is
reflected out of the cells again and gives the appearance
of self-luminosity. The alga, <i>Chromophyton rosanoffii</i>, is
another example of apparent luminosity, due to reflection
from almost spherical cells.</p>

<p>There are several light phenomena known which have
nothing to do with living organisms. Commonest of these
is St. Elmo's fire ("corposants" of English sailors), a
glow accompanying a slow brush discharge of electricity,
which appears as a tip of light on masts of ships, spires
of churches or even the fingers of the hand. It is best seen
in winter during and after snowstorms and is a purely
electrical phenomenon.</p>

<p>Less well known is the <i>Ignis fatuus</i> (Will-o'-the-Wisp,
Jack-o'-Lantern, spunkie), a fire seen over marshes and
stagnant pools, appearing as a pale bluish flame which
may be fixed or move, steady or intermittent. So uncommon
is this phenomenon that its nature is not well understood,
but it is believed to be the result of burning <i>phosphine</i>
(PH<sub>3</sub> + P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), a self-inflammable gas, generated
in some way from the decomposition of organic matter
in the swamp. The difficulty with this explanation is that<!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
phosphine is not known as a decomposition product of
organized matter. Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), a well-known decomposition
product of organic matter and abundantly formed
in swamps, will burn with a pale bluish flame and some
have thought the <i>Ignis fatuus</i> to be the result of this gas.
As methane is not self-inflammable there remains the
difficulty of explaining how it becomes lighted. Although
still a mystery, it is possible that this light is also of
electrical origin or that in some cases large clusters of
luminous fungi have been observed.</p>

<p>The flashing of flowers, especially those of a red or
orange color, like the poppy, which many observers have
noticed during twilight hours, is a purely subjective phenomenon
due to the formation of after images in eyes
partially adapted to the dark. This flashing, first observed
by the daughter of Linn&aelig;us, is never observed in
total darkness or in the direct field of vision, but only in
the indirect field as during a sidelong glance at the plant.</p>

<p>There are some cases of luminosity on record in connection
with man himself. (See Heller, 1854). Before
the days of aseptic and antiseptic surgery, wounds frequently
became infected with luminous bacteria and
glowed at night. The older surgeons even supposed that
luminous wounds were more apt to heal properly than non-luminous
ones. We know that luminous bacteria are
non-pathogenic, harmless organisms and the presence of
these forms even on dead fish or flesh never accompanies
but always precedes putrefaction. As recorded by Robert
Boyle, no harm has come from eating luminous meat,
unless it may also have become infected with pathogenic
forms.</p>

<p>A few cases of luminous individuals have been noted<!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
in which the skin was the source of light, especially if
the person sweated freely. It is possible that here we
are again dealing with luminous bacteria upon the accumulations
of substances passed out in the sweat, which
serves as a nutrient medium.</p>

<p>There are also on record, in the older literature, cases
of luminous urine, where the urine when freshly voided
was luminous. If these observations are correct and they
may, perhaps, be doubted, we are at present uncertain of
the cause of the light. Bacterial infections of the bladder
are not inconceivable although luminous bacteria are
strongly aerobic and would not thrive under anaerobic
conditions. I can state from my own experiments that
luminous bacteria will live in normal human urine, but
not well. In albuminous urines it is very likely that they
would live better, and it is possible that the luminous
urines reported are the results of luminous bacterial
infection. On the other hand, the light may be purely
chemical, due to the oxidation of some compound, an
abnormal incompletely oxidized product of metabolism,
which oxidizes spontaneously in the air. We know that
sometimes these errors in metabolism occur, as in <i>alkaptonuria</i>,
where homogentistic acid is excreted in the urine
and on contact with the air quickly oxidizes to a dark
brown substance. Light, however, has never been reported
to accompany the oxidation of homogentistic acid,
although it does accompany the oxidation of some other
organic compounds. (See Chapter II.)</p>

<p>Finally, we may inquire to what extent luminous
animals may be utilized by man. Leaving out of account
the use of tropical fireflies for adornment by the natives
of the West Indies and South America and the use for bait,<!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in fishing, of the luminous organ of a fish, <i>Photoblepharon</i>,
by the Banda islanders, we find that luminous bacteria are
of value for certain purposes in the laboratory.</p>

<p>These methods are all due to Beijerinck (1889, 1902).
He has, for instance, used luminous bacteria for testing
bacterial filters. If there is a crack in the filter the bacteria
will pass through and a luminous filtrate is the
result, but a perfect filter allows no organisms to pass
and gives a dark filtrate.</p>

<p>Luminous bacteria are also very sensitive to oxygen
and cease to luminesce in its absence. By mixing luminous
bacteria with an emulsion of chloroplasts (from clover
leaves) in the dark, allowing the bacteria to use up all the
oxygen, and then exposing the mixture to light of various
colors, the effect of different wave-lengths in causing
photosynthesis could be studied. Only if the chloroplasts
are exposed to a color in the spectrum which decomposes
CO<sub>2</sub> with liberation of oxygen do the bacteria luminesce,
and when this oxygen is used up by the bacteria, the tube
again becomes dark. Beijerinck has also worked out a
method of testing for maltose and diastase with luminous
bacteria, based on the fact that a certain form, <i>Photobacterium
phosphorescens</i>, will only produce light in presence
of maltose or diastase which will form maltose
from starch.</p>

<p>Although Dubois and Molisch have both prepared
"bacterial lamps" and although it has been suggested that
this method of illumination might be of value in powder
magazines where any sort of flame is too dangerous, it
seems doubtful, to say the least, whether luminous bacteria
can ever be used for illumination. Other forms,
perhaps, might be utilized, but bacteria produce too weak<!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a light for any practical purposes. The history of Science
teaches that it is well never to say that anything is impossible.
It is very unlikely that any luminous animal can
be utilized for practical illumination, but there is no
reason why we cannot learn the method of the firefly.
Then we may, perhaps, go one step further and develop
a really efficient light along similar lines. To what extent
our inquiry into the "secret of the firefly" has been successful
may be gleaned from the following pages.<!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II
<br />
LUMINESCENCE AND INCANDESCENCE</h2>


<p>Modern physical theory supposes that light is a succession
of wave pulses in the ether caused by vibrating
electrons. The light to which we are most accustomed&mdash;sunlight,
electric light, gaslight, etc.,&mdash;is due to electrical
phenomena connected more or less directly with the high
temperature of the source of the light. Every solid body
above the temperature of absolute zero is giving off waves
of different wave-length (&#955;) and frequency (&#957;) but of the
same velocity (&#965;), in vacuo, 180,000 miles, or 300,000 kilometres
a second. In fact, &#965; (a constant)=&#955;<sub>&#957;</sub>, so that it is
only necessary to designate the wave-length in order
to characterize the waves. This is radiant energy or
radiant flux.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, the long waves given off in largest
amount from objects at comparatively low temperatures
give the sensation of warmth. As we raise the temperature,
in addition to these longer heat waves, those of
shorter and shorter wave-length are given off in sufficient
quantity to be detected. At 525&#0176; C., rays of about &#955;=.76&#0181;
in length are just visible as a faint red glow to the eye.
As the temperature increases still shorter wave-lengths
become apparent, and the light changes to dark red (700&#0176;),
cherry red (900&#0176;), dark yellow (1100&#0176;), bright yellow
(1200&#0176;), white-hot (1300&#0176;) and blue-white (1400&#0176; and
above). Above &#955;=.4&#0181; the waves again fail to affect our
eye, and, although they are very active in producing
chemical changes, we have no sense organs for perceiving<!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
them. Thus, a white-hot object liberates radiant energy
or flux of many different wave-lengths corresponding to
what we know as "heat, light and actinic rays." All can
be dispersed by prisms of one or another appropriate
material to form a wide continuous spectrum, such as
that indicated in <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>. Radiant energy of &#955;=.76&#0181; to
&#955;=.4&#0181;, evaluated according to its capacity to produce
the sensation of light, is spoken of as visible radiation
or luminous flux.</p>

<p>Below the infra-red comes a region of wave-length as
yet uninvestigated, and beyond this may be placed the
Hertzian electric waves of long wave-length used in wireless
telegraphy. Above the ultra-violet comes another
region as yet uninvestigated, and then R&#0246;ntgen rays
(X-rays) and radium rays, of exceedingly short wave-length.
These last types need not concern us except in
that we may later inquire if they are given off by luminous
animals. The shortest of the ultra-violet are known as
Schumann and Lyman rays. These relations are brought
out in <a href="#TABLE_2">Table 2</a>.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="TABLE_2" id="TABLE_2"></a>TABLE 2.<br />
<i>Wave-lengths of Various Kinds of Radiation</i></p>

<p>Wave-lengths of light are usually given in &#0197;ngstrom units. One
micron (&#0181;)=.001 mm.=1000 millimicrons (&#0181;&#0181;)=10,000 &#0197;ngstrom units
(&#0197;) or tenth metres=10<sup>-10</sup> metres or 10<sup>-8</sup> centimetres. The entire scale
of wave-lengths extends from 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>-9</sup> centimetres.</p>

spectrum.</p>
</div>

<p>The total radiant energy which a body emits is a function
of its temperature and for a perfect radiator, or what
is known as a black body, the total radiation varies as the
fourth power of the absolute temperature, T. (Stefan-Boltzmann
Law). The radiant energy emitted at different
wave-lengths is not the same but more energy is emitted
at one particular wave-length (&#955;<sub>max.</sub>) than at longer or
shorter ones, depending also on the temperature. If the
various waves are intercepted in some way, their relative
energy can be measured by an appropriate instrument
and spectral energy curves can be drawn, showing the
distribution of energy throughout the spectrum. <a href="#FIG_2">Fig. 2</a>
gives a few of the curves, and it will be noted that the
maximum shifts toward the shorter waves the higher the
temperature. In fact, for a black body &#955;<sub>max.</sub>&#0215;T=2890,
and at 5000&#0176; C. (about the temperature of the sun) &#955;<sub>max.</sub>
lies within the visible spectrum. In gas or electric lights it
lies in the infra-red region. The area enclosed by these
spectral energy curves represents the total energy emitted,
and, knowing this and the area enclosed by the curve of
visible radiation, it is easy to determine how efficient a
source of light is as a light-producing body. We shall
inquire more fully into this question in Chapter III, in considering
the efficiency of the firefly as a source of light.<!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>A body which emits light because of its (high) temperature
is said to be incandescent and we speak of temperature
radiation. We know, however, of many cases
where substances give off light at temperatures much
below 525&#0176; C. They do not follow the Stefan-Boltzmann
law. The light emission is stimulated by some other
means than heat. Such bodies we speak of as <i>luminescent</i>,
and in this category belong all luminous animals. The
distinction between light and luminescence was first
pointed out by Wiedemann (1888). It is usual to classify
luminescences, according to the means of exciting the
light, into the following groups:</p>


<ul><li>Thermoluminescence</li>
<li>Phosphorescence and Fluorescence</li>
<li class="indent1">    Photoluminescence</li>
<li class="indent1">    Cathodoluminescence</li>
<li class="indent1">    Anodoluminescence</li>
<li class="indent1">    Radioluminescence</li>
<li>Triboluminescence and Piezoluminescence</li>
<li>Crystalloluminescence</li>
<li>Chemiluminescence</li></ul>
<p><!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The luminescence which appears in a vacuum tube
when an electric current is passed through it is sometimes
spoken of as <i>electroluminescence</i>. As electroluminescence
and also thermoluminescence are really special cases of
phosphorescence or fluorescence and tribo-and crystalloluminescence
are closely allied, the classification has only
the merit of emphasizing the means of producing light.
Let us examine each kind in turn in order that we may
place the light of animals, <i>organoluminescence</i> or <i>bioluminescence</i>
(or <i>biophotogenesis</i>), in one of these classes.
All are examples of "cold light," light produced at temperature
far below those observed in incandescent solids.
In this category should be placed also the light from salts
in the bunsen flame, for flame spectra and line spectra in
general, while only obtained at relatively high temperatures,
are not to be confused with the purely temperature
radiation from the incandescent particles of carbon in a
gas or candle light. The sodium or lithium flame, etc.,
is not a simple function of temperature and has been
spoken of as a luminescence, <i>pyroluminescence</i>. As the
luminescence of organisms could in no manner be regarded
as a pyroluminescence, occurring at temperatures
far above those compatible with life, a consideration of
this form of luminescence will be omitted. Some other
low temperature flames are known, such as that of CS<sub>2</sub> in
air, rich in ultra-violet rays, despite its relatively low
temperature. While these are of interest to the physicist
and chemist, they can have no direct bearing on the luminescence
of animals and their consideration will also be
omitted. (See Bancroft and Weiser, 1914-1915.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thermoluminescence.</span>&mdash;Some substances begin to emit
light of shorter wave-length than red, well below 525&#0176;.<!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
This is thermoluminescence. Diamond, marble, and fluorite
are examples. Only certain varieties of fluorite show
the phenomenon well. A crystal of one of these varieties
heated in the bunsen flame on an iron spoon will give off
a white light long before any trace of redness appears
in the iron. Other crystals may luminesce in hot water.
In all, this luminescence is dependent on a previous illumination
or radiation of the crystal. If kept in the dark
for a long time no trace of light appears when fluorite is
placed at a temperature of 100&#0176;, but after a short exposure
to the light of an incandescent bulb, although no light can
be observed in the fluorite at room temperature, quite a
bright glow appears at 100&#0176;. Calcium, barium, strontium,
magnesium and other sulphates containing traces of manganese
sulphate, show a similar phenomenon after exposure
to cathode rays (Wiedemann and Schmidt, 1895
b). They emit light during bombardment, but this soon
ceases when the rays are cut off. If the sulphates are now
heated they give off light, red in the case of MgSO<sub>4</sub> +
MnSO<sub>4</sub>, green in the case of CaSO<sub>4</sub> + MnSO<sub>4</sub>. The power
to emit light on heating may be retained for months after
the exposure to cathode rays. The emission of light by
bodies after previous illumination or radiation is called
<i>phosphorescence</i> and will be considered below. It would
seem that the cases of thermoluminescence with which we
are acquainted are really cases of phosphorescence intensified
by rise of temperature. The spectrum of thermoluminescent
bodies, also, is similar to that of phosphorescent
ones. (See <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a>.) However, not all phosphorescent
materials are also thermoluminescent. The production
of light by animals is quite another phenomenon
from thermoluminescence.<!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phosphorescence and Fluorescence.</span>&mdash;Although the
word phosphorescence has been used in a very loose way
to indicate all kinds of luminescence, and particularly that
of phosphorus or of luminous animals, to the physicist
it has a very definite meaning, namely, the absorption of
radiant energy by substances which afterwards give this
off as light. Phosphorescence does not strictly apply to
the light of white phosphorus. If the radiant energy is
light (visible or ultra-violet) we speak of <i>photoluminescence</i>,
if cathode rays we have <i>cathodoluminescence</i>, if
anode rays, <i>anodoluminescence</i>, and if X-rays (R&#0246;ntgen
rays) we have <i>radioluminescence</i>. Inasmuch as the &#945;, &#946;,
and &#947; rays of radium correspond to the anode, cathode,
and X-rays, respectively, radium radiation also produces
luminescence in many kinds of material. If the material
gives off the light only during the time it is radiated we
speak of fluorescence; if the light persists we speak of
phosphorescence. The distinction is perhaps a purely
arbitrary one, as there are a great many substances
which give off light for only a fraction of a second (1/5000
sec. in some cases) after being illuminated (<i>photoluminescence</i>).
Some substances also, which fluoresce at ordinary
temperatures, will phosphoresce at low temperatures.
Phosphorescence is exhibited chiefly by solids, fluorescence
also by liquids and vapors.</p>

<p>Special means must be used to observe a phosphorescence
of short duration. E. Becquerel has devised an
apparatus for doing this, a <i>phosphoroscope</i>. It consists
of revolving disks with holes in them between which the
object to be examined is placed. The holes are so arranged
that the object is first illuminated and then completely
cut off from light. The observer looking at it through<!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
another hole sees it at the moment it is not illuminated
and can thus tell if it is phosphorescing. By determining
the rate of revolution of the disks it is easy to calculate
how long the phosphorescence persists.</p>

<p>While relatively few solids phosphoresce after exposure
to light at ordinary temperature a large number
of these acquire the property at the temperature of liquid
air. Included in the list are such biological products as
urea, salicylic acid, starch, glue and egg shells. The temperature
also affects the wave-length and hence the color
of the light given off. Usually the higher the temperature
the shorter the wave-length, but in the case of some
bodies (SrS) the wave-lengths become longer at the
higher temperature.</p>

<p>The best known cases of phosphorescence which occur
at room temperature and the group to which the word
phosphorescence is commonly applied, are those of the
alkaline earth sulphides (BaS, CaS, SrS) and ZnS. An
Italian, Vicenzo Cascariolo, is said to have discovered the
Bologna stone (BaSO<sub>4</sub>) which, by calcination with charcoal,
gave an impure phosphorescent BaS or <i>lapis solaris</i>.
Canton's phosphorus (CaS) was later prepared "by heating
a mixture of three parts of sifted calcined oyster
shells with one part of sulphur to an intense heat for one
hour." Hulme spoke of it as the "light magnet of Canton,"
because of its power of attracting and absorbing
light. The pure sulphides do not show this property.
Only if small amounts of some other metal such as Cu,
Pb, Ag, Zn, Sb, Ni, Bi, or Mn are present, will the sulphide
phosphoresce. One part of impurity in a million is often
sufficient. Such mixtures, together with a flux of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
<!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>Li<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> or some other fusible salt constitute a "phosphor."
A "phosphor" is in reality an example of a solid
solution and is the basis of some kinds of luminous paints.</p>

<p>The intensity and duration of a phosphorescent light
depend chiefly on the nature of the exciting rays, the color
chiefly on the impurity present but the alkaline earth metal
also exerts an influence. Rise in temperature increases
the intensity but diminishes the duration, so that the
total amount of light emitted is about constant at different
temperatures.</p>

<p>The spectrum of most phosphorescent substances is
made up of one or more continuous bands having <i>maxima</i>
at different wave-lengths. In the light incident on a phosphorescent
substance are also bands of light rays which
are absorbed and whose wave-lengths are more efficient
than others in stimulating phosphorescence. These bands
in the phosphorescent light are usually of longer wave-length
than those in the light which excites the phosphorescence.
This fact is known as Stokes' Law, but it
has been found not to be universally true. Curiously
enough, red and infra-red rays have the power of annulling
phosphorescence after a momentary increase in brightness
and phosphorescing materials have been used to determine
if infra-red rays are given off in the light of the
firefly. Ives (1910) showed that infra-red radiation had
no power of quenching the light of the firefly as it does
the phosphorescent light of Sidot blende (ZnS), one fact
tending to show that the firefly's light is not due to
phosphorescence. <a href="#FIG_3">Fig. 3</a> is a reproduction of a photograph
of the phosphorescence spectrum of ZnS.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3. Spectrum of zinc sulphide phosphorescence (<i>after Ives and Luckiesh</i>). Photographs
were taken by a special device one minute (middle) and fifteen minutes (bottom)
after exposure to the light of the mercury arc and compared with a helium spectrum (top).
In the middle photograph, the mercury exciting lines are visible. It will be noted that the
narrow band of phosphorescent light does not shift its position during decay of phosphorescence.</p>
</div>

<p>Other facts show that the light of luminous animals is
in no sense a phosphorescence and is quite independent
of previous illumination of the animal. Luminous bac<!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>teria
will continue to luminesce although they are grown
in the dark for many weeks. Indeed strong light has
a bactericidal action on these forms similar to that with
ordinary bacteria. With some marine forms light has
an inhibiting effect. They lose their power of luminescence
during the day and only regain it at dusk or when
kept in the dark for some time. Indeed, ordinary light
never has the effect of causing luminescence in the same
sense as it causes phosphorescence of CaS.</p>

<p>Fluorescence is most efficiently excited by the cathode
rays of a vacuum tube. They not only cause the residual
gas in the tube to glow (<i>electroluminescence</i>) by which
their path may be followed with the eye, but also a vivid
fluorescence of the glass walls of the tube, yellow green
with sodium glass, blue green with lead and lithium glass.
LiCl<sub>2</sub> in the path of cathode rays gives off a blue light;
in the path of anode rays a red light; NaCl a blue cathodoluminescence
and a yellow anodoluminescence. The spectrum
of the latter is a line spectrum of Li or Na, showing
the characteristic red or yellow lines similar to those
observed where Li or Na is held in the bunsen flame. The
spectrum of the salts under excitation of cathode rays
is a short continuous one in the blue region. Fluorescent
spectra in general are of this nature, made up of short
bands of light in one or more regions.</p>

<p>Diamonds, rubies and many minerals fluoresce brilliantly
in the path of cathode rays. Some specimens of
fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>) show the phenomenon especially well,
whence the name <i>fluorescence</i>. Fluorescent screens of
barium platinocyanide, willemite (Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), Sidot blend
(ZnS) or Scheelite (Ca tungstate) are frequently employed
to render visible X-rays. The luminous paint most<!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
used at the present time is ZnS containing a trace of
radium salt. The rays of the radium continually emitted
cause a steady fluorescence of the ZnS. Indeed, if one
examines the paint on the hands of a watch with a lens the
flash of light from the impact of alpha particles on the
ZnS can be distinctly seen, as in the <i>spinthariscope</i>.</p>

<p>Some animal tissues and fluids, especially the lens of
the eye, will luminesce in the path of radium rays, as shown
by the experiments of Exner (1903), but there is no evidence
that luminous animals are especially active in
this respect. Ultra-violet rays have the same action.</p>

<p>The luminous material of practically all luminous
forms, if dessicated sufficiently rapidly, can be obtained in
the form of a dry powder which will give off light when
moistened with water. Coblentz (1912) has exposed this
dry material to light, to the ultra-violet spark, and to
X-rays and in no case has a phosphorescence or fluorescence
ever been observed. I have examined the action
of radium upon <i>Cypridina</i> light. There was no intensifying
or diminishing effect of twenty milligrams of radium
(probably the bromide) on a luminous solution of <i>Cypridina</i>
material, nor was phosphorescence or fluorescence
excited in a non-luminous extract of the animal. We
must conclude that animal light is not a fluorescence of
any substance due to radiation produced by the animals
themselves.</p>

<p>Many solutions show fluorescence in strong lights.
This is especially marked in quinine sulphate, mineral oils,
eosin, fluorescein, esculin, rhodamin, chlorophyll, etc. The
fluorescence of eosin in 10<sup>-8</sup> grams per cubic centimetre is
visible in daylight and 10<sup>-15</sup> grams per cubic centimetre in
the beam from an arc lamp. It is difficult to realize that the<!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
bluish fluorescence of quinine sulphate is really an emission
rather than a reflection of light. But a test tube of
quinine sulphate solution held in the ultra-violet region of
a spectrum will glow with a pale blue light, although it is
not illuminated with any rays that are visible to our eyes.
Concerning this, Stokes, to whom the word fluorescence
and much of our knowledge of the subject is due, says,
"It was certainly a curious sight to see the tube" (containing
quinine sulphate solution) "instantaneously lighted
up when plunged into the invisible rays; it was literally
'darkness visible.'" Quinine sulphate absorbs the ultra-violet
converting these rays into visible blue ones. Its
spectrum is a short continuous one. Most fluorescent substances
convert short into longer wave-lengths (Stokes'
Law), but some may cause the reverse change.</p>

<p>A substance, fluorescent in solution, has been found in
a few luminous animals, notably in several species of
fireflies and also in a non-luminous beetle. It is called
<i>pyrophorine</i> or <i>luciferesceine</i>. Dubois (1886) has
ascribed to pyrophorine the power of absorbing invisible
rays and transforming them into visible ones, thus increasing
the animal's light. That this is not the case has been
shown by the work of Coblentz (1909). He photographed
the spectrum of the firefly's light and the fluorescent spectrum
of luciferesceine. The latter is almost complementary
to the former (see <a href="#FIG_4">Fig. 4</a>) and no trace of the fluorescent
spectrum appears in the spectrum of the light of the
firefly. McDermott (1911 <i>a</i>) has studied the properties of
luciferesceine and regards it merely as an incidental
material found in many animals of the <i>Lampyrid&aelig;</i> (in
some non-luminous forms) and having no connection with<!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
the light production. A trace of alkali usually increases
and acid inhibits the fluorescence of solutions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Triboluminescence and Piezoluminescence.</span>&mdash;Under
this head are grouped a number of light phenomena which
at first sight may appear to be electrical in nature but in
reality are not. The light is produced by shaking, rubbing,
or crushing crystals, and only crystalline bodies appear
to show <i>triboluminescence</i> or <i>piezoluminescence</i>. A striking
case is that of uranium nitrate. Gentle agitation of
the crystals is sufficient to give off sparks of light which
much resemble the scintillations of dinoflagellates when
sea-water containing these animals is agitated. If Romberg's
phosphorus, which is fused CaCl<sub>2</sub>, is rubbed on the
sleeve, it glows with a greenish light. Lumps of cane
sugar rubbed together will glow. Saccharin crystals will
also light if shaken and Pope (1899) found that the bluish
light of saccharin was bright enough to be visible in a
room in daytime. It only appeared from impure crystals
and freshly crystallized specimens. Other crystals, also,
have been found to lose their power of lighting after
a time.</p>

<p>Among biological substances, cane sugar, milk sugar,
mannite, hippuric acid, asparagin, <i>r</i>-tartaric acid, <i>l</i>-malic
acid, vanillin, cocaine, atropin, benzoic acid, and many
others show triboluminescence. A long list is given by
Tschugaeff (1901), by Trautz (1905), and by Gernez
(1905). The spectrum is a short continuous one, the waves
emitted depending on the kind of crystal. Thus the color
of the light varies among different santonin derivatives
from yellow to green. In saccharin it is blue.</p>

<p>Although the light produced by some living organisms
resembles triboluminescence in that it may be evoked by<!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
rubbing or shaking the animals, it is in reality fundamentally
different since it is dependent on the presence of
oxygen whereas triboluminescence is not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crystalloluminescence.</span>&mdash;Crystalloluminescence is
observed when solutions crystallize. It was described by
Bandrowski (1894, 1895) in arsenious oxide, in NaF, or if
HCl or alcohol is added to hot saturated NaCl solution.
A bluish light with sparkling points appeared. All well
authenticated cases are exhibited by simple inorganic
salts and these are also all triboluminescent. The reverse
is not true, however; many triboluminescent substances
are not crystalloluminescent. Crystalloluminescence
is much less widespread than triboluminescence.
Trautz (1905) has studied the matter in a number of compounds
and comes to the conclusion that the light is really
a special case of triboluminescence in which the growth of
individual crystals causes them to rub together. The
light becomes much brighter on stirring a mass of crystals
which exhibit crystalloluminescence. While in some cases
crystalloluminescence is unquestionably due to the triboluminescence
of crystals rubbing against each other it is not
in every case, as has been clearly shown by the work of
Weiser (1918 <i>b</i>). He studied luminescence of saturated
aqueous alkali halide solutions (NaCl, KCl, etc.,) upon
addition of alcohol or of HCl. The salt crystallizes out
under these conditions and Weiser found that the light is
brightest when the conditions of concentration of alcohol
or of HCl are such as to cause heaping up of Na and Cl
ions. He believes that the bluish light which appears is
due to the combination of ions in the reaction, Na<sup>+</sup> +
Cl<sup>-</sup> = NaCl. Only if this proceeds rapidly enough does
luminescence occur. Weiser studied also the crystallo<!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>luminescence
and triboluminescence of AsCl<sub>3</sub> and of
K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. By photographing the luminescence through color
screens of different absorptive power (Weiser, 1918, <i>a</i>)
a spectrum of the light could be obtained, and it was
found to be identical in both the tribo- and crystalloluminescent
light; in the case of AsCl<sub>3</sub>, a band in the
green-blue, blue and violet. Weiser believes the light
in this case also to come from recombination of the ions,
As<sup>+++</sup> + 3Cl<sup>-</sup> = AsCl<sub>3</sub>, and that crystalloluminescence in
general is due to rapid reformation of molecules from
ions broken up by electrolytic dissociation while triboluminescence
is due to rapid reformation of molecules from
ions broken up by violent disruption of the crystal. Of
course in triboluminescent organic crystals which do not
dissociate into ions, some other reaction must be responsible
for the light. One thing seems certain, that the two
types of luminescence are similar. As Bigelow<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> remarks,
"It is altogether probable that the cause of this" (crystalloluminescence)
"whatever it may be, is the same as the
cause of triboluminescence, whatever that may be."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Theoretical and Physical Chemistry, 1912, p. 516.</p></div>

<p>Crystals are not found in the luminous organs of animals
with the exception of the fireflies. In these a layer of
cells occurs (see Chapter IV) filled with minute crystals
of one of the purine bodies (xanthin or uric acid). One
might surmise that the light of the animal was a crystalloluminescence
accompanying the formation of these crystals.
It is easy to show, however, that the light comes
not from the crystal layer but from another layer of cells
containing large granules. It is also dependent on the
presence of oxygen while crystalloluminescence takes
place in the absence of oxygen. The crystal layer possibly<!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
serves as a reflector. Its significance will be discussed
in a later chapter.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5.&mdash;Dubois&#39;s figures showing transformation
of photogenic granules to crystals
(<i>after Dubois</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>The light of luminous organisms is quite generally
associated with granules. In one of the centipedes (<i>Orya
barbarica</i>), which produces a luminous secretion, Dubois
(1893) has described the transformation of these granules
into crystals and at one time he supposed the light to be
a crystalloluminescence. He later reversed this opinion
and, certainly, examination of his drawings which are
reproduced in <a href="#FIG_5">Fig. 5</a> does not convince one of the actuality
of crystal formation.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of <i>lyoluminescence</i>, described by<!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Wiedemann and Schmidt (1895) as a light accompanying
the solution of colored (from exposure to cathode rays)
crystals of Li, Na, or K chlorides, is probably due to a
triboluminescence from stirring of the crystals during
solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chemiluminescence</span>.&mdash;As the name implies, chemiluminescence
is the production of light during a chemical
reaction at low temperatures. This does not mean that
the other types of luminescence are not connected with
chemical reactions&mdash;using the word <i>reaction</i> in a broad
sense&mdash;for we have reason to believe that in some cases
spectra are not characteristic of the element as such but
are rather characteristic of a particular reaction in which
the element takes part (dissociation into ions, changes
from monovalent to bivalent condition, etc.) and that this
is the reason one element may show various spectra under
different conditions (Bancroft, 1913). The chemiluminescences
are rather oxidation reactions involving the absorption
of gaseous or dissolved oxygen and may be very
easily distinguished from all the previously mentioned
luminescences by this criterion. They should, perhaps,
more properly be called <i>oxyluminescences</i>.</p>

<p>The glow of phosphorus is the best known case, recognized
since phosphorus was first prepared by Brandt in
1669. It is interesting to note that when first prepared
phosphorus was regarded as a peculiarly persistent type
of phosphor, <i>i.e.</i>, a material akin to the impure alkaline
earth sulphides.</p>

<p>Fresh cut surfaces of Na and K metal will glow in the
dark for some time, especially if warmed to 60&#0176;-70&#0176;
(Linnemann, 1858). A film of oxide is formed over the
surface, showing definitely that oxidation has occurred.<!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Ozone oxidizes organic matter with an accompanying glow
(Fahrig, 1890; Otto, 1896). The light from ozone acting
on pyrogallol solution is especially bright under certain
conditions.</p>

<p>Radziszewski (1877, 1880) gives a long list of substances,
chiefly essential oils, which luminesce if slowly
oxidized in alcoholic solutions of alkalis. Formaldehyde,
dioxymethylen, paraldehyde, metaldehyde, acrole&#0239;n, disacryl,
aldehydeammonia, acrylammonia, hydrobenzamid,
lophin, hydroanisamid, anisidin, hydrocuminamid, hydrocinamid,
besides waxes, and such biological substances as
glucose, lecithin, cholesterin, cholic, taurocholic, and
glycocholic acids, and cerebrin, all luminesce on oxidation.
Radziszewski himself and many other authors have compared
the light of organisms to this type of luminescence.
Indeed the incorrect identification of granules found in
the cells of practically all luminous tissues as oil droplets,
is largely due to the influence of Radziszewski's work.
Dubois (1901 <i>b</i>) has added esculin, and Trautz (1904-5)
many aldehydes and phenol derivatives, including vanillin,
papaverin, tannic and gallic acids, besides glycerol and
mannite to the list of biological substances oxidizing with
light production. Guinchant (1905) has described oxyluminescence
of uric acid and asparagine, Weitlaner
(1911) of substances in humus and McDermott (1913)
of substances in urine and the anaerobic alkaline hydrolysis
products of glue and Witte's peptone. Pyrogallol
is especially prone to luminesce, as was first noticed by
Lenard and Wolf (1888) in developing a photographic
plate with pyrogallol developer. Later the luminescence
was studied in some detail by Trautz and Schloringin
(1904-5) who developed the well-known luminescent mix<!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>ture
of pyrogallol, formaldehyde, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As
I have shown, pyrogallol can be oxidized in a great many
different ways, and some of these are of great interest,
for they very closely imitate the mechanism for the production
of light in organisms. These are recorded in
<a href="#TABLE_3">Table 3</a>, which also includes various other types of oxyluminescence
of general or biological interest.</p>

<p>The spectrum of chemiluminescent reactions has been
described in a few instances as continuous but no definite
measurements of its extent have been made. Radziszew<!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>ski
(1880) found the light of lophin oxidized in alcoholic
caustic alkali, examined with a two-prism spectroscope,
to give a continuous spectrum, brightest at <i>E</i>, with the
red and violet ends lacking. Trautz (1905, p. 101) states
that the pyrogallol-formaldehyde-Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reaction
gives a continuous spectrum from the red to the blue green
with maximum brightness in the orange. Weiser (1918
<i>a</i>) has studied the spectra of some chemiluminescent reactions
by photographing the light behind a series of color
screens. He finds also that the spectra are short, with
maximum intensity in various regions. Thus, <i>amarin</i>
oxidized by chlorine or bromine, extends from the yellow
to greenish blue with a maximum in the green while <i>phosphorus</i>,
dissolved in glacial acetic acid and oxidized with
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, luminesces from yellow green to violet.</p>

<p>The spectra of luminous animals are quite similar to
those of chemiluminescent reactions. Moreover, as we
have seen, chemiluminescence is essentially an oxyluminescence,
since oxygen is necessary for the reaction. All
luminous animals also require oxygen for light production.
Therefore, bioluminescence and chemiluminescence are
similar phenomena and they differ from all the other
forms of luminescence which we have considered. The
light from luminous animals is due to the oxidation of
some substance produced in their cells, and when we can
write the structural formula of this photogenic substance
and tell how the oxidation proceeds, the problem of light
production in animals will be solved.<!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III
<br />
PHYSICAL NATURE OF ANIMAL LIGHT</h2>


<p>Interest in the light of animals from a physical standpoint
has centred around questions of quality, efficiency
and intensity, but in only one group of luminous animals,
the beetles, have accurate measurements of these characteristics
been made. This is due in part to the abundance
of these forms and their appeal to human interest and in
part because they are among the brightest of luminous organisms.
Weak lights are not only difficult to measure but,
when dispersed to form spectra, give bands so faint that
their limits are very difficult to see and more so to photograph.
Very few organisms produce light visible to the
fully light-adapted eye. Although their light may seem
quite bright to the dark-adapted eye, the dark-adapted eye
is a poor judge of the quality, <i>i.e.</i>, the color of a light.
This is because of the Purkinje phenomenon, a change in
the region of maximum sensibility of the retina with
change in intensity of the light. For an equal energy
spectrum, to the normal, completely light-adapted eye,
yellow-green light of wave-length, &#955; = .565&#0181;, appears the
brightest, but when the light is made fainter the maximum
shifts first to the green and then to the blue. The dark-adapted
eye can see green or blue better than yellow and
for this reason weak lights will appear more green or
blue than stronger ones of the same energy distribution.
Also two weak lights of the same spectral composition
may appear different in color if they differ much in intensity.
This is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>.<!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>The shift in sensibility of the eye occurs in illuminations
of between 0.5 and 50 metre-candles and represents a
change from central cone vision (high intensities) to
peripheral rod vision (low intensities). The <i>fovea centralis</i>
lacks rods and this part of the eye becomes practically
color blind at very low intensities of light. Below
0.5 and above 50 metre-candles visibility varies but little
with change in intensity. It is clearly necessary then to
distinguish between the physical objective phenomenon
of light and the physiological subjective sensation of light.</p>

<p>It is a fact that different luminous animals produce
light of quite different colors as judged by our eye. A
range of spectral tints has been described which extends
from red to violet but "yellowish," "greenish" and
"bluish" tints are commonest. Indeed one or two animals
possess several luminous organs emitting lights of different
colors. This is true in a South American firefly, <i>Phengodes</i>,<!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
whose lights are red and greenish yellow, and in the
deep sea squid, <i>Thaumatolampas diadema</i>, which produces
lights of three colors, two shades of blue and red. The
red light in the case of the squid appears to be due to a
red color screen formed by the chromatophores, but in
<i>Phengodes</i> no screen is present.</p>

<p>As we have seen, difference in color of the light does
not necessarily indicate difference in spectral composition
because of the Purkinje effect. However, examination of
the spectrum of various luminous forms has very clearly
indicated that the different colors are really due to light
rays of different wave-length and are not the result of any
subjective phenomena. To facilitate comparison, spectral
lines and colors are given in <a href="#TABLE_4">Table 4</a>. The first adequate
observations on the spectra of luminous animals were
made by Pasteur (1864), who studied <i>Pyrophorus</i> and
found a continuous spectrum unbroken by light or dark
bands. Lankester (1868) discovered a similar continuous
spectrum in <i>Ch&aelig;topterus insignis</i> and placed its
limits from line 5 to 10 on Sorby's Scale (about &#955; = 0.55&#0181;<!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to &#955; = 0.44&#0181;). Young (1870) first recorded the limits of
the firefly spectrum as a little above <i>C</i> (&#955; = .6563&#0181;) to
<i>F</i> (&#955; = .4861&#0181;). Since then a number of luminous forms
have been examined and all are found to give short continuous
spectra (not crossed by light or dark bands or
lines) lying in different color regions. Thus, Conroy
(1882) examined the glowworm (<i>Lampyris noctiluca</i>)
light and observed a band extending from &#955; = 0.518&#0181; to
&#955; = 0.656&#0181;. Dubois (1886) states that the spectrum of
<i>Pyrophorus noctilucus</i>, the West Indian "Cucullo," extends
from slightly further than the Fraunhofer <i>B</i> line
to the <i>F</i> line, while Langley and Very (1890), working
on the same form, placed the limits at &#955; = 0.468&#0181; to<!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
&#955; = 0.640&#0181;. It consists, then, of a broad band chiefly in the
green and yellow. But, "would the light not extend
farther were it bright enough to be seen?... if the light
of the insect were as bright as that of the sun would it not
extend equally far on either side of the spectrum?" "It
is impossible to increase the intrinsic brilliancy by any
optical device, but if it be impossible to make the light
of the insect as bright as that of the sun, it is on the other
hand quite possible to make the light of the sun no
brighter than that of the insect ..." Langley and Very
investigated this question, forming a solar spectrum from
sunlight of the same intensity as that of <i>Pyrophorus</i> and a
<i>Pyrophorus</i> spectrum together in the same field of the
spectroscope. The latter was very much shorter than the
solar spectrum, showing that its length was not due to
weakness of the red and blue rays but to their absence.
Later Ives and Coblentz (1910) photographed the spectrum
of a firefly (<i>Photinus pyralis</i>), together with that of
a carbon glow lamp, on plates sensitive to all wave-lengths
of visible rays under conditions which would have recorded
all visible radiations given off. They found the
spectrum to extend only from &#955; = 0.51&#0181; to &#955; = 0.67&#0181; (<a href="#FIG_7">Fig.
7</a>). Another species of firefly (<i>Photuris pennsylvanica</i>)
was found by Coblentz (1912) to give a spectrum extending
from &#955; = 0.51&#0181; to &#955; = 0.59&#0181; (<a href="#FIG_8">Fig. 8</a>). The <i>Photinus</i>
light extends much further into the red and it is easy to
distinguish between <i>Photinus</i> and <i>Photuris</i> in nature,
merely by the reddish tint of the light of the former.
These photographic records show conclusively that the
color of the light of luminous animals is not a subjective
phenomenon due to the Purkinje effect and the low intensity
of the light, but is real, an actual difference in spec<!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>tral
composition of the light emitted. Neither is it due,
at least in the fireflies examined, to the existence of color
screens which absorb certain rays, allowing only those
of a definite color to pass. The spectra of forms thus far
investigated are reproduced in <a href="#FIG_9">Fig. 9</a> and recorded in
<a href="#Table_5">Table 5</a>. It will be noted that they vary considerably
in position but are all of the same type. The spectrum
of <i>Cypridina hilgendorfii</i> is the longest thus far investigated
(&#955; = .610&#0181; to &#955; = .415&#0181;), extending well into the
blue, and the light of this form is very blue in appearance.</p>

<p>As first shown by Dubois (1886) for <i>Pyrophorus</i>, and
confirmed by myself for <i>Cypridina</i>, the light is not polarized
in any way. I may add that the <i>Cypridina</i> light like
any other light may be polarized by passing through a
Nicol prism.</p>

<p>Several writers [Dubois (1914 book)], Fischer (1888),
Molisch (1904 book) have noticed that the light of luminous
bacteria changes in color if grown on different culture
media. Light which is "silver white" on dead fish becomes
"greenish" on salt-peptone-gelatin media and more
yellow on salt-poor media. Peron (1804) and Panceri
(1872) describe the light of <i>Pyrosoma</i> as yellow to greenish
after death of the animal and reddish on stimulation;
then fading out through orange, yellow, greenish and
azure blue. Polimanti (1911) describes the normal light
of <i>Pyrosoma</i> as greenish, and states that as the animals
die, or if they are kept at temperatures above the optimum,
the light becomes more red. McDermott (1911, <i>b</i>) noticed
that the light of fireflies placed in liquid air became decidedly
reddish just before going out and on rewarming the
first light to appear was reddish followed by the proper
shade at higher temperatures. I have frequently observed<!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a more reddish color from luminous tissues of the
firefly upon the addition of coagulants such as alcohol, and
have noted that the light of <i>Cypridina</i> becomes weaker
and more yellow at both low (0&#0176;) and high (50&#0176;) temperatures.
The meaning of these color changes will be
discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII</a>.</p>

<p>The efficiency of any light may be defined in several
different ways: (1) By the percentage of visible wave-lengths
in the total amount of radiation emitted, <i>i.e.</i>,
visible radiation divided by total (heat, visible, actinic)
radiation; (2) by considering, in addition to visible radiation
&#0247; total radiation, the sensibility of the eye to different
wave-lengths, visible radiation &#0215; visual sensibility &#0247;
total radiation. Visible radiation &#0215; visual sensibility is
spoken of as luminosity; (3) by the amount of light (expressed
in candles) produced in relation to a given expenditure
of energy or in relation to the cost of the energy
expended. Thus, of the radiation emitted from an incandescent
electric lamp only a small per cent. is light, the
rest being heat and actinic rays. It is therefore very far
from being 100 per cent. efficient. If there were no infra-red
or ultra-violet in the radiation from an incandescent
lamp its efficiency would be 100 per cent. if we disregarded
visual sensibility. But if we take into account the fact
that the eye is most sensitive to yellow green, a source of
light, even though emitting only visible radiation, would
not be 100 per cent. efficient unless its maximum of emission
corresponded also with the maximum of visual sensibility.
We shall return to this question in a later paragraph.
Looking at the question from the standpoint of
energy consumption, the carbon incandescent lamp gives
one mean spherical candle for 4.83 watts (watt = 10<sup>7</sup> ergs<!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
per sec.), while the tungsten lamp gives one mean spherical
candle for 1.6 watts, about one-third the energy, and
the latter is consequently more efficient.</p>

<p>As we know practically nothing of the energy transformations
occurring during the process of light production
in organisms, all statements regarding the efficiency
of their light are based on relations between the visible
radiation and total radiation. This involves a measurement
of rays in the infra-red region (heat rays) and ultra-violet
region (actinic rays) as well as the light rays
proper, and any other radiant energy produced. While
all spectroscopic investigations show that the spectrum of
luminous animals never extends to the limits of the visible
spectrum in either the red or violet, it is possible that
bands occur in the infra-red or ultra-violet, and special
methods must be employed to detect these. Radiations of
all kinds, if converted into heat on striking the blackened
surface of a thermopile, bolometer, or radiometer can be
measured by changes in temperature and the relative
amounts of energy represented be compared in a common
unit, the calorie. By proper screening, all rays except the
visible light rays can be cut off from the measuring instrument
and the amounts of energy represented in light and
in total radiation thus be determined.</p>

<p>Dubois (1886) first studied this problem in <i>Pyrophorus</i>
by the use of a thermopile and galvanometer and found
a small amount of radiation from the luminous region in
excess of that from a non-luminous region. It amounted
to a galvanometer deflection of 0.95&#0176; and was increased
0.3&#0176; during the flash of the insect on electrical stimulation.
This increase of 0.3&#0176; is possibly due to heat produced on
muscular contraction. In any case the amount of heat<!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
radiated in comparison with that of the candle is very
small indeed. A more careful study has been made by
Langley and Very (1890) with the bolometer. They point
out first of all that the total radiation from the most
powerful luminous organ (the abdominal one) of <i>Pyrophorus</i>
which affected their bolometer slightly, would, in
the same time (10 seconds), be sufficient to raise the temperature
of an ordinary mercurial thermometer having a
bulb 1 cm. in diameter by rather less than 2.3 &#0215; 10<sup>-6</sup>&#0176; C.
We may thus gain some idea of the magnitude of the measurements
to be made. The radiation from <i>Pyrophorus</i>
which affected their bolometer was shown to be due merely
to the "body heat"<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the insect, and it is largely cut
off by a plate of glass which is opaque to all wave-lengths
of 3&#0181; or more. These waves are given off by bodies at
temperatures below 50&#0176; C. and belong "to quite another
spectral region to that in which the invisible heat associated
with light mainly appears." Langley and Very then
compared the radiation from a non-luminous bunsen flame
and the <i>Pyrophorus</i> light, interposing a plate of glass in
each case to cut off the waves longer than 3&#0181;, and found
several hundred times more radiation in the case of the
bunsen burner but, nevertheless, perceptible radiation
from <i>Pyrophorus</i>. The former consisted of radiant heat
shorter than &#955; = 3&#0181; and extending up to the visible light
rays (&#955; = 0.7&#0181; since the bunsen flame emitted no light).
The very slight effect of the <i>Pyrophorus</i> radiation must
be due to wave-lengths between &#955; = 3&#0181; and &#955; = 0.468&#0181;, the
limit of the <i>Pyrophorus</i> spectrum in the blue. Langley
and Very assumed it to be due entirely to the band of<!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
visible light, &#955; = 0.640&#0181; to &#955; = 0.468&#0181;, and assumed that no
invisible heat rays were produced. All of the energy of
<i>Pyrophorus</i> light would therefore lie in the visible region
and its efficiency (light rays &#0247; heat + light + actinic
rays) would be 100 per cent. Later, Langley (1902) reinvestigated
the radiation of <i>Pyrophorus</i> and could detect
no heating whatever with the bolometer. "A portion of the
flame of a standard sperm candle, equal in area to the
bright part of the insects, gave under the same circumstances,
a bolometric effect of such magnitude that had
the heat of the insect been 1/80,000 as great as that from
the candle, it would certainly have been recognized."
Coblentz (1912) also, using a vacuum thermopile of Pt
and Bi, was unable to detect any infra-red radiation from
<i>Photinus pyralis</i>, but found that the temperature of this
firefly is slightly lower than the air. These temperature
measurements will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Langley and Very evidently supposed that the body temperature of the
firefly, like the mammal or bird, is higher than its surroundings.</p></div>

<p>The assumption of Langley and Very that the small
amount of <i>Pyrophorus</i> radiation passing glass is all light
has been called into question by Ives (1910), who points
out that Langley and Very failed to use a screen which
would cut off either the visible rays or the invisible rays
between 3&#0181; and 0.7&#0181;. They really left the question open
as to whether the effect of <i>Pyrophorus</i> light on their bolometer
was due to the visible band of rays or to this plus
another band in the infra-red. "The firefly's actual efficiency
as a light source is dependent to a large degree on
the radiation being confined to the visible region. If
there should be found infra-red of quantity comparable
to the visible, the firefly, while still a very efficient source
would not be, as usually supposed, the example of an
ideally efficient light produced by nature."<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Ives investigated the question further by the phosphor-photographic
method. "In brief it consists of this: Phosphorescence,
which is excited in various substances by
exposure to short waves (blue, violet or ultra-violet), is
destroyed by exposure to longer waves (orange, red, infra-red).
Thus, a surface of Balmain's paint or of Sidot
blende, excited to phosphorescence and then exposed in a
spectrograph, will have areas of reduced brightness wherever
long-wave energy has fallen upon it. If this surface
is then laid on a photographic plate for a short period,
a permanent record is obtained on the plate after development."
Preliminary tests showed that the method was
applicable in the case of weak light such as the firefly
spectrum and also if the light is intermittent like the firefly.
With Sidot blend (ZnS) the extinguishing action extends
from &#955; = 0.6&#0181; to &#955; = 1.5&#0181;. A sheet of deep ruby
glass, which cut off all the visible rays of the firefly but
allowed infra-red to pass, was placed between the firefly
light and a surface of phosphorescent Sidot blend which
was exposed to the firefly flashes for three and a half
hours. No extinction of phosphorescence occurred, while
without the ruby glass, extinction, due to the orange rays
of the <i>visible</i> firefly light was noticeable in 20 minutes.
There is thus no infra-red of an intensity at all comparable
to the visible as far as &#955; = 1.5&#0181;, the lower limit of the
phosphor-photographic method. Coblentz (1912) had examined
the transparency of the dry chitinous integument
of various fireflies (<a href="#FIG_10">Fig. 10</a>) in the infra-red and reports
it to be fairly transparent down to &#955; = 2.8&#0181;, opaque between
&#955; = 2.8&#0181; and &#955; = 3.8&#0181;, transparent again to &#955; = 6&#0181;,
and opaque beyond that. The infra-red could, then, if it
were emitted, largely pass through the integument which<!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
is similar in absorption properties to complex carbohydrates.
Transparency of the integument to the ultra-violet
was not studied.</p>

</div>

<p>Although photographs of the spectrum of firefly (<i>Photinus</i>)
light show that it extends only to the beginning
of the blue, Forsyth (1910) reports ultra-violet radiation
in luminous bacteria. He exposed a plate for 48 hours to
the spectrum of bacterial light dispersed by a quartz prism
and got a continuous band from &#955; = 0.50&#0181; (the lower limit
of sensitivity of the plate) to &#955; = 0.35&#0181;. However, McDermott
(1911 <i>d</i>) was unable to observe fluorescence of
p-amino-ortho-sulpho-benzoic acid, which responds to the
ultra-violet light. Molisch (1904, book) photographed bacterial
and fungus light through glass and through a piece
of quartz and found no difference in density on the plate.
As the exposure was brief, to avoid saturation, and as the
ultra-violet, which passes quartz but not glass, has a much<!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
greater action on the plate than visible light, we must
conclude that ultra-violet is absent. Ives (1910) investigated
the spectrum of <i>Photinus pyralis</i>, using a quartz
spectroscope, and found no evidence of ultra-violet radiation,
at least as far as &#955; = 0.216&#0181;.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the radiation from the firefly
has been very carefully studied and that no waves are
given off from &#955; = 1.5&#0181; to &#955; = 0.216&#0181; with the exception of
the short band (&#955; = 0.67&#0181; to &#955; = 0.51&#0181;) in the visible, and
it is highly probable that no radiation is given off with
wave-lengths longer than &#955; = 1.5&#0181;. The firefly light
remains, then, 100 per cent. efficient, differing from all
our artificial sources of light, the best of which does not
approach this value. As Langley and Very express it in
the title to their paper, it is "the cheapest form of light,"
not cheapest in the sense of that we can reproduce it
commercially at less cost than other lights, but cheaper
in the sense that it is the most economical in the energy
radiated. This energy is all light and no heat. "Cold
light" has actually been developed by the firefly and
concerning which "we know of nothing to prevent our
successfully imitating."</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that we may also consider
the efficiency of a light in relation to the sensibility of
our own eye. That is, we take into account not only the
energy distribution in the spectrum of the light but also
the fact that different wave-lengths of an equal energy
spectrum affect our eye very differently. As the normal
light-adapted eye is most sensitive to yellow green of
&#955; = 0.565&#0181;, monochromatic light of this wave-length will
appear much brighter than monochromatic light of any
other wave-length with the same energy. Monochromatic<!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
light of &#955; = 0.565&#0181; will then be the theoretically most efficient
possible, when we consider the energy radiated in
relation to the sensitivity of our eye. This is the usual
method of determining the luminous efficiency of artificial<!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
lights and is obtained from a knowledge of the radiated
energy and the visual sensibility. Reduced luminous efficiency
= light (<i>radiated energy</i> &#0215; <i>visual sensibility</i>) or
luminosity &#0247; total radiated energy.</p>

<p>The spectral energy curve for the firefly has been worked out by Ives and
Coblentz (1910), using a photographic method in which the intensities of
different wave-lengths of the firefly (<i>Photinus pyralis</i>) light is
com<!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>pared with that of a carbon glow lamp by measuring the amount of
photochemical change produced on panchromatic photographic plates. <a href="#FIG_11">Fig.
11</a> gives the energy curves of various fireflies and the carbon glow lamp
in the same spectral region. The visual sensibility curve used by Ives
and Coblentz is that of Nutting (1908, 1911), based on Konig's data. It
is reproduced in <a href="#FIG_6">Fig. 6</a>. The latest visibility curve is that of Hyde,
Forsyth and Cady (1918), reproduced in <a href="#FIG_12">Fig. 12</a>. It is based on
observations of twenty-nine individuals. As individuals vary considerably
in their sensibility to different wave-lengths, the visibility curve
represents an average, but it is the only standard we have with which to
evaluate the energy we call light. Color-blind individuals would have a
visibility curve very different from normal individuals. Composite curves
showing the luminous efficiency of the 4-watt carbon glow lamp and the
firefly, both in relation to visibility, are given in Figs. <a href="#FIG_13">13</a> and <a href="#FIG_14">14</a>,
respectively. In these figures<!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> the luminous efficiency is the shaded
area &#0247; total area, 0.43 per cent. for the carbon glow lamp and 99.5 per
cent. for the firefly, "these numbers representing the relative amounts
of light (measured on a photometer) for equal amounts of radiated
energy&mdash;a striking illustration of the wastefulness of artificial methods
of light production. From the specific consumption of the tungsten lamp
(1.6 watts per spherical candle) and the mercury arc (.55 watts per
spherical candle) we obtained by comparison with the carbon filament that
their luminous efficiencies are 1.3 and 3.8 per cent. The most efficient
artificial illuminant therefore has about 4 per cent. of the luminous
efficiency of the<!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> firefly." This is calculated to be .02 watts per
candle. More recent determinations (Coblentz, 1912), using a new
sensibility curve of Nutting's (1911) for a partially light-adapted eye,
give the reduced luminous efficiency as 87 per cent. for <i>Photinus
pyralis</i>, 80 per cent. for <i>Photinus consanguineus</i> and 92 per cent. for
<i>Photuris pennsylvanica</i>.</p>

<p>The firefly light by the above method of calculating
efficiency is not 100 per cent. efficient because its maximum
(&#955; = 0.567&#0181;) does not correspond with the maximum
sensibility of the eye (&#955; = 0.565&#0181;), but taking into consideration
also other effects of color, the firefly light would
be a still more inefficient and trying one for artificial illumination,
as all objects would appear a nearly uniform<!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
green hue. Indeed the distortion would be even greater
than with the mercury arc, whose objectionable green hue
is so well known. "We may say, therefore, that the firefly
has carried the striving for efficiency too far to be
acceptable to human use; it has produced the most efficient
light known, as far as amount of light for expenditure of
energy is concerned, but has produced it at the (inevitable)
expense of range of color. The most efficient light for
human use, taking into account both color and energy-light
relationships, would be a light similar to the firefly
light containing no radiation beyond the visible spectrum,
but differing from it by being white." (Ives, 1910.) Although
the spectral energy curve for <i>Cypridina</i> light has
not been worked out, it will be noted that the <i>Cypridina</i>
spectrum is much longer than that of the firefly, more
nearly approaching the spectrum of an incandescent solid
giving white light. It approaches, but does not attain
the ideal.</p>

<p>Although Muraoka (1896) and Singh and Maulik
(1911) have described radiations coming from fireflies
which would pass opaque objects and affect a photographic
plate, and Dubois reports the same from bacteria, the
existence of such radiation has been denied by Suchsland
(1898), Schurig (1901) and Molisch (1904 book). The
experiments of Molisch on luminous bacteria are of greatest
interest, for they are very carefully controlled and
show without a doubt that black paper or Zn, Al, or Cu
sheet will allow no rays from these organisms to pass
that will affect a photographic plate, even after several
days' exposure. The <i>visible</i> light of luminous bacteria
will affect the plate after one second exposure. Moreover,
Molisch has pointed out the errors of those who claim to<!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
have found penetrating radiation in luminous forms. It
seems that certain kinds of cardboard, especially yellow
varieties, or wood, will give off vapors that affect the
photographic plate. The action is especially marked with
damp cardboard at a temperature of 25&#0176;-35&#0176; C., and
Dubois and Muraoka must have used such cardboard to
cover their plates. A piece of old dry section of beech
or oak trunk, placed on a photographic plate for 15 hours
in a totally dark place, will register a beautiful picture of
the annual rings of growth, medullary rays, junction of
bark and wood, etc. Russell (1897) had previously found
that many bodies, both metals and substances of organic
origin (gums, wood, paper, etc.), placed in contact with
photographic plates, would affect them, and concluded
that vapors and not rays were the active agents. As a dry
piece of wood has a very definite smell, there is something
given off which can affect our nose and there is no reason
why it should not change, by purely chemical action, the
photographic plate. This action of wood on the plate is
prevented by interposing a sheet of glass. Frankland
(1898) has described similar vapors coming from colonies
of <i>Bacillus proteus vulgaris</i> and <i>B. coli communis</i> which
affect a photographic plate laid directly over the colonies
in an open petri dish. There is no effect if the glass cover
of the petri dish is between plate and bacteria. There is,
then, no specific emission of X-rays or similar penetrating
radiation from luminous tissues which will affect the photographic
plate through opaque screens.</p>

<p>A similar conclusion is reached if we attack the problem
in another way. X-rays and radium rays (Becquerel
rays) cause fluorescence of ZnS, barium platinocyanide,<!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
willemite (Zn<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>), and calcium tungstate. Coblentz
(1912) showed that the firefly will cause no fluorescence of
a barium platinocyanide screen and I have been unable
to detect fluorescence of zinc sulphide, barium platinocyanide,
zinc silicate (willemite) or calcium tungstate shielded
from <i>Cypridina</i> light by black paper, although the light
of this organism is quite bright enough to cause phosphorescence
of zinc sulphide without the black paper. The
samples of the above four substances all showed fluorescence
in presence of radium rays, but only the ZnS phosphoresces
after exposure to light rays, although
the willemite was phosphorescent after exposure to
the ultra-violet.</p>

<p>While photometry at low intensities is a difficult procedure
at best, if the light varies in intensity or is a flash,
accurate measurements become well-nigh impossible. The
figures given for intensity of animal luminescence must,
therefore, be accepted with a realization of the difficulties
of measurement. By candle is meant the international
candle, unless otherwise specified, equal to 1.11 Hefner
candles (H. K.) 0.1 pentane lamp and 0.104 carcel units.
It is a measure of intensity.</p>

<p>Amount of light, or light flux, measured in lumens, is
that emitted in a unit solid angle (area/<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>) by a point
source of one candle-power. One candle-power emits 4&#960;
lumens. The latest figure for the mechanical equivalent
of light at &#955; = .566 is .0015 watt (Hyde, Forsyth and Cady,
1919), <i>i.e.</i>, 1 lumen = .0015 watt. One watt is 10<sup>7</sup> ergs (one
joule) per second.</p>

<p>The illumination (of a surface) is that given by one
candle at one metre, the candle metre (C.M.) or lux. The<!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
surface then receives one lumen per square metre. A
metre kerze (M.K.) is the illumination given by one
Hefner candle at one metre distance.</p>

<p>The brightness of a surface is measured in lamberts or
millilamberts. A lambert is "the brightness of a perfectly
diffusing surface radiating or reflecting one lumen per
square cm." A millilambert is 1/1000 lambert. For further
definitions the reader is referred to the reports of the
committee on nomenclature of the Illuminating Engineering
Society.</p>

<p>Dubois (1886) states that one of the prothoracic organs
of <i>Pyrophorus noctilucus</i> has a light intensity of 1/150
Ph&#339;nix candle of eight to the pound (probably about
equivalent to 1/150 candle) and that 37 or 38 beetles (each
using all three light organs) would produce light equivalent
to one Ph&#339;nix candle. Langley (1890) found that to
the eye the prothoracic organ of <i>Pyrophorus noctilucus</i>
gave one-eighth as much light as an equal area of a candle
and the actual candle-power of the insect was 1/1600
candle. It may be remarked in passing how widely divergent
these observations are.</p>

<p>For the flash of the firefly (<i>Photinus pyralis</i>) Coblentz
(1912) found variation from 1/50 to 1/400 candle, the
predominating values being around 1/400 candle. A continuous
steady glow is sometimes obtained from this insect
and it proved to be of the order of 1/50,000 candle.</p>

<p>Steady sources of light can be more easily measured
and we have two records of the light intensity from luminous
organisms with continuous light. One of these is a
fish, <i>Photoblepharon palpebratus</i>, with a large luminous
organ under the eye, of flattened oval shape, 11 &#0215; 5 mm.,
which glows continuously without change of intensity.<!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
The organ can be darkened by a screen similar to an eyelid
which pulls up over it. Steche (1909) reports the intensity
to be .0024 M.K.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The metre-kerze is a unit of illumination, not of intensity, and is
incorrectly used by Steche.</p></div>

<p>Luminous bacteria probably glow with less intensity
than any other organism. The light from a single organism
cannot be seen but that from a colony is visible to the
dark-adapted eye. Even so we must remember that the
eye is an exceedingly delicate instrument which can detect
very small energy changes. The "minimum radiation
visually perceptible" has been calculated by Reeves (1917)
to be in the neighborhood of 18 &#0215; 10<sup>-10</sup> ergs per second
and the light from a small colony of luminous bacteria
represents little more radiation than this.</p>

<p>Lode (1904, 1908), by a modified grease spot photometer
method, ascertained that the light of his brightest
bacterial colony of <i>Vibrio rumple</i> had an intensity of
7.85 &#0215; 10<sup>-10</sup> H.K. per sq. mm. or 0.785 H.K. per 1000
sq. metres (=0.562 German-normal candles per 1000 sq.
metres). In round numbers this is about one German-normal
candle per 2000 sq. metres, or two to three times this
area for the light from an ordinary stearin candle. Lode
calculated that the dome of St. Peter's at Rome, if covered
with bacteria, would give little more light than a common
stearin candle. An ordinary room of 50 sq. metres wall
and ceiling area would give out only 0.039 German-normal
candle. It does not seem likely that luminous bacteria
will ever come into vogue for illuminating purposes.
Friedberger and Doepner (1907) by a photographic
method, not entirely free from error, found that one
square millimetre of lighting surface of a bouillon culture<!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of photobacteria gave 6.8 &#0215; 10<sup>-9</sup> German-normal candles,
about ten times Lode's value. Even at this rate commercial
lighting by luminous bacteria does not appear a
promising field for investors.</p>

<p>To sum up, we may say that light from animal sources
is in no way different from light of ordinary sources, except
in intensity and spectral extent. It is all visible light,
containing no infra-red or ultra-violet radiation or rays
which are capable of penetrating opaque objects. It is not
polarized as produced, but may be polarized by passing
through a Nichol prism. Like ordinary light, animal light
will also cause fluorescence and phosphorescence of substances,
affect a photographic plate, cause marked heliotropism
of plant seedlings (Nadson, 1903) and stimulate
the formation of chlorophyll (Issatschenko, 1903, 1907).
Because of the weakness of bacterial light, etiolated seedlings
do not become green to the eye (Molisch, 1912 book),
but a small amount of chlorophyll is formed which can be
recognized by the spectroscope because of its absorption
bands.<!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<br />
STRUCTURE OF LUMINOUS ORGANS</h2>


<p>The production of light is the converse of the detection
of light. In the first case chemical energy is converted
into radiant energy; in the second case radiant energy is
converted into chemical energy. The lantern of the firefly
is an organ of <i>chemi-photic</i> change; the eye is an organ
of <i>photo-chemical</i> change. While it is theoretically probable
that all reactions which proceed in one direction under
the influence of light, will proceed in the opposite direction
with the evolution of light, the formation of luciferin from
oxyluciferin (described in Chapter VI) is the only one
definitely known. Perhaps we may place in this category
also the instances of photoluminescence, but the chemical
reaction involved cannot be pointed out.</p>

<p>We know of no animal whose eyes, the organs, <i>par
excellence</i>, of photochemical change, give off light in the
dark. All cases of luminous eyes have been conclusively
shown to be purely reflection phenomena. The eyes of a
cat only glow if some stray light is present which may
enter and be reflected out again. Photochemical reactions
and chemiluminescent reactions do have this in common,
however, that they are largely but not exclusively oxidations.
Whether all photochemical changes in the eyes in
animals require oxygen or not, is unknown, but all animal
light-producing reactions, without exception, are oxidations,
and light is only produced if oxygen is present.
Some material is oxidized.<!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>In general, we may divide luminous organisms into
two great classes according as the oxidizable material is
burned within the cell where it is formed or is secreted
to the exterior and is burned outside&mdash;intracellular and
extracellular luminescence. Many animals with intracellular
luminescence have quite complicated luminous
organs. It is an interesting fact that a great similarity
may be observed between the evolution of the complex
organs of vision and of these complicated organs. In the
simplest unicellular forms certain structures within the
cell serve as the photochemical detectors of light, while
in luminous protozoa, similarly, granules scattered
throughout the cell are oxidized with light production. In
the higher forms the eye contains groups of photosensitive
cells connected with afferent nerves, lenses, and accessory
structures for properly adjusting the light, while luminous
organs contain groups of photogenic cells in connection
with efferent nerves, lenses, and accessory structures
for properly directing the light. It is interesting
to note that in the two groups where the eye has attained
its highest development, the cephalopods and vertebrates,
here also the luminous organ is found in greatest complexity
and perfection. In intermediate stages of evolution
the eye and luminous organ so closely approach each other
in structure that it is still a mooted question whether certain
organs found in worms and crustacea are intended
for receiving or producing light.</p>

<p>We may also divide luminous forms into two groups
according as the oxidation of luminous material goes on
continuously, independently of any stimulation of the
organism; or is intermittent, oxidation and luminescence
occurring only as a result of stimulation, using the word<!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
"stimulation" in the same sense in which it is used in
connection with nerve or muscle tissue. Bacteria, fungi,
and a few fish produce light continuously and independently
of stimulation. Its intensity varies only over long
periods of time and is dependent on the nature of the
nutrient medium or general physiological condition of
the organism. All other forms give off no light until they
are stimulated. Stimulation may of course come from
the inside (nerves) or outside. Only under unfavorable
conditions, such as will eventually lead to the destruction
of the luminous cells, do these forms give off a continuous
light. This has often been spoken of as the "death glow,"
and is to be compared with <i>rigor</i> in muscle tissue.</p>

<p>Some of the fish which produce a continuous light possess
a movable screen similar to an eyelid which can be
drawn across the organ, thus shutting off the light, so that
the animal appears to belong to the group which flashes
on stimulation. This is true of <i>Photoblepharon</i>, while
<i>Anomalops</i> can rotate the light organ itself downward,
so as to bring the lighting surface against the body wall
and thus cut off the light (Steche, 1909). Other fish
(<i>Monocentris</i>) are unable to "turn off" their light.</p>

<p>Animals which flash spontaneously on stimulation
through nerves from within, possess a very varied rhythm.
The different species of fireflies can be distinguished by
the character of their flashing (McDermott, 1910-17;
Mast, 1912). <a href="#FIG_16">Fig. 16</a> shows the method of flashing of
some common eastern North America species. The glowworm
light lasts for many seconds and then dies out. This
interval of darkness persists for some minutes and is then
followed by another period of glowing. Some fireflies have
a light which may be described as partially intermittent.<!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
It lasts for hours, but may become more dim or be intensified
on stimulation.</p>

horizontally = approximately one second. The flash of the males (&#9794;) is at the left; that
of females (&#9792;) at right of chart.</p>
</div>

<p>Some forms only produce light at certain seasons of
the year. According to Giesbrecht (1895) this is true of
the copepods, which only light in summer and autumn,
and according to Greene (1899) in the toad-fish; <i>Porichthys</i>,<!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
which can only be stimulated to luminesce during the
spawning season in spring and early summer.</p>

<p>Some animals possess a periodicity of luminescence.
They only luminesce at night and fail to respond to stimulation
or are difficult to stimulate during the day. Bright
light has an inhibiting effect. Perhaps correlated with
this is the fact that most luminous forms are strongly
negatively heliotropic. Fireflies lie hidden in the day, to
appear about dusk and the ostracod crustacean, <i>Cypridina</i>,
is difficult to obtain on moonlight nights.</p>

<p>The Ctenophores were the first forms in which the
inhibiting effect of light was noticed. This was described
by Allman (1862) and has been confirmed by a number of
observers, especially Peters (1905). Massart found that
<i>Noctiluca</i> was difficult to stimulate during the day and
<i>Ceratium</i>, according to both Zacharias (1905) and Moore
(1908), only luminesces at night, or if kept in darkness,
for some little time. Crozier<a name="FNanchor_4_1" id="FNanchor_4_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> finds a persistent day-night
rhythm of light production when <i>Ptychodera</i>, a balanoglossid,
is maintained for eight days in continued darkness.
The animal is difficult to stimulate during the
period which corresponds to day and luminesces brilliantly
and at the slightest touch during the period which
corresponds to night.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a great many forms are able to
luminesce quite independently of previous illumination.
According to Crozier<a name="FNanchor_4_2" id="FNanchor_4_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> <i>Ch&aelig;topterus</i> luminescence is not
affected by an exposure to 3000 metre-candles for
six hours.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_1"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Private communication.</p></div>

<p>In the case of animals with extracellular luminescence
we may speak of luminous secretions and true luminous<!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
glands. A large number of forms possess luminous glands
or gland cells, including some of the <i>medus&aelig;</i>, the hydroids
(probably), the pennatulids (?), the molluscs (<i>Pholas</i> and
<i>Phyllirho&#0235;</i>) (probably), some cephalopods (<i>Heteroteuthis</i>
and <i>Sepietta</i>), most annelids, ostracods, copepods, some
schizopods (<i>Gnathophausia</i>) and decapod (<i>Heterocarpus</i>
and <i>Aristeus</i>) crustaceans, all myriapods, and the balanoglossids.
The remaining organisms burn their material
within the cell. These include the bacteria, fungi, protozoa,
some medus&aelig; (?), ctenophores (probably), most
cephalopods, a few annelids (<i>Tomopterus</i> (?)), ophiuroids
(?), some schizopod (<i>Nyctiphanes</i>, <i>Euphasia</i>, <i>Nematocelis</i>,
<i>Stylochiron</i>) and decapod (<i>Sergestes</i>) crustacea,
all(?) insects, <i>Pyrosoma</i>, and fishes (<i>selachians</i> and <i>teleosts</i>).
It is among this latter type that the most complicated
luminous organs have been developed. While a
description of all the types of luminous organs and luminous
structures cannot be attempted here (excellent descriptions
have been given by Dahlgren and Mangold) it
is necessary to understand the structural conditions
in a few of the forms whose physiology has attracted
most attention.</p>

<p>Luminous bacteria are so small that the light from a
single individual cannot be seen. It is almost impossible
to make out structural differences within the cell and we
cannot definitely state in just what special region, if any,
the luminescence is produced. We do know that the light
is intracellular and that filtration of the bacteria from
their culture medium gives a dark sterile filtrate absolutely
free from any luminous secretion.</p>

<p>Among protozoa, in certain forms at least, it is easy to
observe that luminescence is connected with globules or<!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
granules which were considered by the earlier observers
to be oil droplets. Thus, in <i>Noctiluca</i> (Figs. <a href="#FIG_17">17</a> and <a href="#FIG_18">18</a>),
when the animal is violently stimulated or in the presence
of reagents which slowly kill it, the whole interior appears
a mass of starry points of light which can be traced to
minute granules along the strands of protoplasm (Quatrefages,
1850).</p>

</div>

<p>Turning to the multicellular forms, we find the simplest
development of luminosity in those animals which possess
gland cells producing a luminous secretion. These cells
may be scattered over the surface of the animal as in
<i>Ch&aelig;topterus</i> (<a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>) or <i>Cavernularia</i>, or restricted to
certain areas [<i>Pholas</i>, (<a href="#FIG_19">Fig. 19</a>),] or more definitely localized
to form an isolated group of gland cells as in <i>Cypridina</i>.
True multicellular glands also occur. In every case,
however, we find that the luminosity of these uni- or multicellular
glands is connected with the presence of granules.
They are often spoken of as <i>luciferine granules</i>, although
it is not certain whether they are made up of luciferin or
luciferase (see Chapter IV) or both. They are most similar
to the zymogen granules found so abundantly in gland
cells and thought to be the precursors of various enzymes.
According to Dahlgren (1915), the luciferine granules
stain blue-black by iron h&aelig;matoxylon after fixation at
the boiling point, and photogenic cells can be detected
by this method of selective staining. Dubois (1914, book),
who regards them as examples of <i>bioprotein</i>, comparable
to the chondriosomes and handed on from one generation
to another, gives them the name of <i>vacuolides</i> or <i>macrozymases</i>.
In some forms he has described their transformation
into crystals and believed at one time that animal
light was a crystalloluminescence. His figures of the<!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
crystal transformation are not very convincing. Pierantoni
(1915) has considered the granules to be <i>symbiotic</i>
luminous bacteria, but this is certainly not the case.</p>

areas (<i>after Panceri</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>The light of <i>Ch&aelig;topterus</i> comes from a material mixed
with a mucous secretion formed over almost the whole
body surfaces of the animal. A section of the epithelium
shows large mucous-producing cells and smaller
granule-containing light cells (<a href="#FIG_20">Fig. 20</a>). These appear to
be under nervous control, as a strong stimulation in one
part of the body causes luminescence which spreads over
the whole surface of the worm. The animal becomes
fatigued rather readily, however. In the pennatulids,
such as <i>Cavernularia</i>, we have also the formation of a
luminous secretion over the whole surface of the body
and the individual animals in this colonial form are also
connected with nerves. A stimulation in any local region,
as Panceri (1872) first showed (<a href="#FIG_21">Fig. 21</a>), will cause a wave
of luminosity to spread from this point until it extends
over the whole surface of the colony. In <i>Pennatula</i> the
rate of this luminous wave is about 5 cm. per second.</p>

<p><i>Pholas dactylus</i> possesses similar light cells to those
of <i>Ch&aelig;topterus</i>, but they are restricted to narrow bands
on the siphon and mantle and a pair of triangular spots
near the retractor muscles. Nerves pass to the luminous
regions.</p>

<p>In many luminous animals the light secretion formed
over the surface of the body is small in amount and
adheres to the animal because it is embedded in the mucous
skin secretions. In those forms which possess a true
localized light gland the luminous secretion when expelled
into the sea water (if the animal be a marine form) may
persist as a luminous streak for some time and exhibit<!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
diffusion and convection movements. The most beautiful
examples of luminous secretions are found among the

<p>In <i>Cypridina hilgendorfii</i> the luminous gland is situated
on the upper lip near the mouth. It is made up of
elongate (some 0.7 mm. in length), spindle-shaped cells,
each one of which opens by a separate pore with a kind
of valve. The openings are arranged on five protuberances.
Muscle fibres pass between the gland cells in such
a way that by contracting the secretion can be forced out.
In the sea water the secretion luminesces brilliantly
and the Japanese call these forms <i>umi hotaru</i>, or marine
fireflies. <a href="#FIG_22">Fig. 22</a> is a diagram showing the structure.
Watanabe (1897), who first studied this form, and also
Yatsu (1917) have described two kinds of granule-containing
cells, one with large yellow globules, 4-10&#0181; in
diameter (<a href="#FIG_23">Fig. 23</a>), the other with small colorless granules
0.5, in diameter. I have observed in the living form these
two types and also large colorless globules of the same size
as the yellow globules. All dissolve when extruded into
the sea water. Dahlgren<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> has described from sections
four types of cells containing (1) large globules,
(2) small granules, (3) a fat-like material, (4) a mucous
material. Just what the significance and nature of these
types of substance is cannot be stated at present. At
least one, probably two, are concerned in light production.
The others may possibly form digestive fluids which act
on the food of the animal.</p>

<p>Turning now to the animals possessing light cells with
intracellular luminescence we find in general that such
light cells are localized to form definite light organs and<!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
that these may be single, as in the common fireflies, paired,
as the prothoracic light organs of <i>Pyrophorus</i>, or scattered
over the surface of the body, as in so many shrimps,
cephalopods and fishes, when they are often called photophores.
The light cells proper are often associated with
reflectors, lenses, opaque screens and color screens.</p>

common firefly (<i>a lampyrid beetle</i>) of Eastern North
America, has probably been developed from the fat body,
while in the New Zealand glowworm, the larva of a tipulid
fly (<i>Bolitophila luminosa</i>), part of the Malpighian tubule
cells have acquired photogenic power (Wheeler and
Williams, 1915). This is illustrated in <a href="#FIG_24">Fig. 24</a>.</p>

<p>The photogenic organ of the firefly is made up of two
kinds of cells, a dorsal mass of small cells several layers
deep, the reflector layer, and a ventral mass of large cells
with indistinct boundaries, the photogenic layer (<a href="#FIG_25">Fig. 25</a>).
The photogenic cells contain a mass of granules, spherical
in the male and short rods in the female. The photogenic
cells are divided into groups by large tracheal trunks
which pass into the light organ and branch to form tracheoles
connected with tracheal end cells. The exact distribution
varies in different species, but in all the arrangement
is such as to give a very abundant oxygen supply.
Each group of photogenic cells is surrounded by a clear
ectoplasm containing no granules. The tracheoles pass
through this and either end openly within the photogenic
cells or anastomose with tracheoles from neighboring
trache&aelig;. Nerves, but no blood-vessels&mdash;which are absent
in insects&mdash;enter the organ. It is difficult to determine
if the nerves supply the tracheal end cells or the photogenic
cells.</p>

<p>The dorsal reflecting layer is made up of cells containing
numerous minute crystals of some purin base, either
xanthin or urates, or both. They have a white milky
appearance and while they are certainly not good reflectors
in the optical sense, they do act as a white back<!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>ground,
scatter incident light, and partially prevent its
penetration to the internal organs of the firefly. Although
a few crystals similar to those of the reflector layer are
found in the photogenic cells and in other cells of the
body, it is known that the photogenic cells are not transformed
into the reflector cells. The two layers are distinct
and permanent from an early stage in development.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the light organ of the larva of the
firefly (glowworm) is quite distinct from that of the adult.
Like so many other structures in insects, the adult organ
is developed anew from potential photogenic cells during
the pupal period. Even the egg of the firefly is luminous
and glows with a steady light, and during the pupal
period light may sometimes be seen coming from the
thoracic region.</p>

<p>In the firefly there is no true lens, the light merely
shining through the cuticle which is transparent over the
light organ, whereas over the rest of the body it is dark
and pigmented. In the deep sea shrimp, <i>Acanthephyra
debelis</i>, with light organs scattered over the surface of
the body, the cuticle covering the light organ forms a concavo-convex
lens, behind which are the photogenic cells
(Kemp, 1910). As may be seen from <a href="#FIG_26">Fig. 26</a>, the lens is
made up of three layers which suggests that it may be
corrected for chromatic aberration&mdash;a veritable "achromatic
triplet." In an allied form, <i>Sergestes</i> (<a href="#FIG_27">Fig. 27</a>),
the lens is of two layers and double convex. Optical
studies of these lanterns have been made by Trojan
(1907). The course of the light rays is shown in <a href="#FIG_28">Fig. 28</a>.
The lens of these organs is also bluish in color which suggests
that they may serve also as color filters. Behind
the photogenic cells is a mass of connective tissues through<!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
which enters the nerve, for the light of these organs is
under the control of the animal and may be flashed
"at will."</p>

<p>All gradations in complexity of light organs may be
found from the condition in the shrimp just described to
that found among the squid and fish. Figs. <a href="#FIG_29">29</a> and <a href="#FIG_30">30</a> are
sections of two of the more complicated types found in
squid. The explanation given to the various structures is
that of Chun (1903) to whom we are indebted for a careful
histological investigation of these forms. It will be noted
that in addition to photogenic and lens tissues there are
various types of reflector cells and a line of pigment about
the whole inner surface of the organ to effectively screen
the animal's tissues from the light. In one form <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
(<a href="#FIG_30">Fig. 30</a>) chromatophores are found about the region where the
light is emitted and these no doubt serve as color filters.
There are also an abundant blood supply and nerves passing
to the organ. Figs. <a href="#FIG_30">30</a> and <a href="#FIG_31">31</a> are sections through
light organs of fishes.</p>

<p>We thus see that light organs may be very simple and<!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
also very complicated. The latter must have evolved
from the former, although it is not always possible to point
out the intermediate stages. It is not within the scope
of this book to discuss bioluminescence in its evolutionary
aspects. It may be worth while, however, to point out
briefly what is known concerning the use of the light to the
animal. There are four possibilities.</p>

<p>We know that luminous bacteria occasionally lose the
power of lighting and that on certain culture media they
develop as non-luminous forms. Luminescence is not
indispensable to them. The same is true of some of the<!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
fungi but <i>Noctiluca</i> and other animals are not known in
a non-luminous condition, although we can see no definite
value to the organism of this power of luminescence.</p>

<p>In the case of sea pens, however, we might suppose
that the light acts as an attraction to small organisms on
which the sea pen feeds, although these creatures only
luminesce when stimulated in some way, which rather detracts
from the above suggestion.</p>

<p>(2) The light may act as a warning to scare away
predacious animals which would otherwise feed on the
luminous organism. Perhaps this is the case in the sea
pens, although these forms possess nematocysts which
should serve as adequate protection. The marine worm,
<i>Ch&aelig;topterus</i>, is brightly luminous and lives its whole life
in an opaque parchment tube. If this tube were torn open
by a predacious form we might conceive that the attacking
animal would be alarmed by the light and refrain from
destroying the worm. The <i>Ch&aelig;topterus</i>, however, could
not rebuild another tube and its light would only protect
it in the night time. These cases will suffice to indicate
the difficulties and perplexities of the problem. Perhaps
we may add one more guess and suppose that the light of
certain fishes is actually for blinding or distracting their
enemies or blinding the forms on which they feed. Until
this use of luminous organs has actually been observed, we
can give little credence to it.</p>

<p>(3) The light may serve as a means of recognition
or a sex signal to bring the sexes together for mating. It
would seem from the work of Mast and of McDermott that
this is the case in the common fireflies and it may be the
case in the toad-fish, <i>Poricthys</i>, which is only luminous
in the spawning season and in the worm, <i>Odontosyllis</i>, of<!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Bermuda, which is brilliantly luminous while swarming
when the eggs and sperm are shed. It is non-luminous
at other times (Galloway and Welch, 1911.)</p>

<p>(4) Finally, it is possible that animals with complex
luminous organs, such as squid, fish and shrimp,
actually use these as lanterns. It is significant that most
of them are deep sea forms, living in a region of perpetual
darkness, and it is perfectly logical to suppose that they
make use of their light organs for illuminating purposes.</p>

<p>The whole problem of the use and purpose of luminous
organs is an exceedingly complex and difficult one. We
have, perhaps, said enough to indicate this and may add
that in most cases, so far as opinion is based on actual
evidence and observation, that of the layman is of as
great value as that of the scientist.<!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<br />
THE CHEMISTRY OF LIGHT PRODUCTION, PART I</h2>


<p>Two experiments, both performed very early in the
history of Bioluminescence, are of great importance in
understanding the nature of animal light. Boyle (1667),
as already mentioned, proved the necessity of air for the
luminescence of wood and fish and Spallanzani (1794)
showed that parts of luminous medus&aelig; gave no light
when dried but if moistened again would emit light as
before. We see then, that air (oxygen), water, and some
photogenic substance are necessary for the light production.
Spallanzani's experiment, which has been confirmed
for a great many luminous forms, shows also that animal
luminescence is not a <i>vital</i> process, in the same sense that
the conduction of a nerve impulse is a vital process. A
nerve loses its characteristic property of conduction on
drying or maceration while luminous cells still possess
the power to luminesce after drying or maceration. Using
the terminology of the older physiology we may say that
"living protoplasm" is not necessary for light production.</p>

<p>The experiments of Boyle (1626-91) are of great interest,
especially those in which he studied the behavior of
shining wood under the receiver of his air pump. On
October 29, 1667, he wrote:</p>

<p>"Exp. I.: Having procured a Piece of <i>shining Wood</i>,
about the bigness of a groat or less, that gave a vivid
Light, (for <i>rotten Wood</i>) we put it into a middle sized<!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<i>Receiver</i>, so as it was kept from touching the Cement;
and the <i>Pump</i> being set a-work, we observed not, during
the 5 or 6 first Exsuctions of the Air, that the splendor
of the included Wood was manifestly lessened (though
it was never at all increased;) but about the 7th Suck, it
seemed to glow a little more dim, and afterwards answered
our Expectation, by losing of its Light more and more, as
the Air was still farther pumped out; till at length about
the 10th Exsuction, (though by the removal of the Candles
out of the Room, and by black Cloaths and Hats we made
the place as dark as we could, yet) we could not perceive
any light at all to proceed from the <i>Wood</i>.</p>

<p>"Exp. II.: Wherefore we let in the outward Air by
Degrees and had the pleasure to see the seemingly extinguished
Light revive so fast and perfectly, that it looked
to us almost like a little Flash of Lightning, and the Splendor
of the Wood seemed rather greater than at all less,
than before it was put into the Receiver."</p>

<p>Boyle proved that light from the wood was able to pass
a vacuum and later showed that "shining fish" behaved
as the "shining wood," but that a piece of white hot iron
would not regain its light on readmitting air to the exhausted
receiver and that the iron lost its glow under the
air-pump merely because it cooled off. A piece of glowing
coal, however, did lose its light in the absence of air and
regained it on again admitting air, provided the air had
not been removed for too long. Boyle was apparently
impressed with the similarity of the light giving process
in glowing coal and shining wood as he draws a comparison
between the two which brings out the fundamental
similarity of combustion processes.<!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Resemblances:</p>

<p>VII. The Things wherein I observed a Piece of <i>shining
Wood</i> and a <i>burning Coal</i> to agree or <i>resemble</i> each other
are principally these <i>five</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Both of them are <i>Luminaries</i>, that is, give <i>Light</i>, as
having it (if I may so speak) <i>residing in them</i>;
and not like <i>Looking-glasses</i>, or <i>white Bodies</i>,
which are conspicuous only by the <i>incident Beams</i>
of the <i>Sun</i>, or some other <i>luminous Body</i>, which
they <i>reflect</i>....</p>

<p>2. Both <i>shining Wood</i> and a <i>burning Coal</i> need the
Presence of the Air (and that too of such a <i>Density</i>
to make them continue <i>shining</i>)....</p>

<p>3. Both <i>shining Wood</i> and a <i>burning Coal</i>, having been
deprived, for a Time, of their <i>Light</i>, by the withdrawing
of the contiguous <i>Air</i>, may presently
recover it by letting in fresh <i>Air</i> upon them....</p>

<p>4. Both a <i>quick Coal</i> and <i>shining Wood</i> will be easily
quenched by <i>Water</i> and <i>many other Liquors</i>....</p>

<p>5. As a <i>quick Coal</i> is not to be <i>extinguished</i> by the
Coldness of the <i>Air</i>, when it is greater than ordinary;
so neither is a Piece of <i>shining Wood</i> to be
deprived of its <i>Light</i> by the same Quality of
the <i>Air</i>....</p></div>

<p>Differences:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The first Difference I observed betwixt a <i>live Coal</i>
and a <i>shining Wood</i> is, that whereas the <i>Light</i>
of the <i>former</i> is readily <i>extinguishable</i> by <i>Compression</i>
(as is obvious in the Practice of suddenly<!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<i>extinguishing</i> a piece of <i>Coal</i> by treading upon it),
I could not find that such a <i>Compression</i> as I
could conveniently give without losing sight of
its operation, would <i>put out</i>, or much injure the
<i>Light</i>, even of small Fragments of <i>shining</i>
Wood....</p>

<p>2. The next <i>Unlikeness</i> to be taken notice of betwixt
<i>rotten Wood</i> and a <i>kindled Coal</i> is, that the latter
will, in a very few <i>Minutes</i>, be totally <i>extinguished</i>
by the withdrawing of the <i>Air</i>; whereas a Piece
of <i>shining Wood</i>, being eclipsed by the Absence
of the <i>Air</i>, and kept so for a Time, will immediately
<i>recover</i> its <i>Light</i> if the <i>Air</i> be let in upon it
again within half an hour after it was first
withdrawn....</p>

<p>3. The next <i>Difference</i> to be mentioned is, that a <i>live
Coal</i>, being put into a small close Glass, will not
continue to <i>burn</i> for very many <i>Minutes</i>; but a
Piece of <i>shining Wood</i> will continue to shine for
<i>some</i> whole <i>Days</i>....</p>

<p>4. A <i>fourth Difference</i> may be this: that whereas a
<i>Coal</i>, as it <i>burns</i>, sends forth Store of <i>Smoke</i> or
<i>Exhalations</i>, <i>luminous Wood</i> does not so.</p>

<p>5. A <i>fifth</i>, flowing from the former, is, that whereas a
<i>Coal</i> in <i>shining</i> wastes itself at a great Rate,
<i>shining Wood</i> does not....</p>

<p>6. The last Difference I shall take notice of betwixt
the bodies hitherto compared is, that a <i>quick Coal</i>
is actually and vehemently hot; whereas I have
not observed <i>shining Wood</i> to be so much as sensibly
<i>lukewarm</i>."</p></div>

<p><!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be clearly borne in mind that if we place luminous
organisms, say bacteria or fungi, in an atmosphere
devoid of oxygen and find that no light is produced, this
may merely mean that certain functions of the cell are
interfered with, including light production, but does not
necessarily indicate that oxygen is actually used up in
the photogenic process. If we find, however, that extracts
of luminous cells or luminous secretions devoid of
cells cease to light when the oxygen is removed and again
luminesce when it is returned, we may be quite certain
that the photogenic process itself requires free oxygen.
As luminous extracts of fireflies, pennatulids, ostracods,
<i>Pholas</i> and others give off no light when the oxygen is
removed, we may safely conclude that for these luminescences,
oxygen is necessary. Bacteria, fungi, and <i>Noctiluca</i>,
whose light also disappears in absence of oxygen,
although they are whole cells, we may by analogy also
assume to require oxygen in the photogenic process.</p>

<p>Some of the earlier workers on fireflies and <i>Noctiluca</i>
obtained light even after placing these organisms in absence
of oxygen, but they did not realize how low is the
amount of oxygen necessary to produce light. It is difficult
to remove traces of oxygen from the water, traces
which are nevertheless sufficient to cause luminescence.
If the organisms are numerous, as in an emulsion of
luminous bacteria, they will themselves use up all the
oxygen and the liquid soon ceases to glow except at the
surface in contact with air. We may gain an idea of the
amount of oxygen necessary for luminescence from an
experiment of Beijerinck (1902). He mixed luminous
bacteria with an emulsion of clover leaves containing
chloroplasts and kept the two in the dark until all the<!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
oxygen was used up and the bacteria ceased to glow.
If now a match was struck for a fraction of a second,
sufficient oxygen was formed by photosynthesis to cause
the bacteria to luminesce for a short time.</p>

<p>Exact figures on the minimal concentration of oxygen
for luminescence cannot be given. The luminescent secretion
of <i>Cypridina hilgendorfii</i> will still give off much light
if hydrogen containing only 0.4 per cent. of oxygen is
bubbled through it, <i>i.e.</i>, a partial oxygen pressure of 1/250
atmosphere (3.04 mm.Hg). However, addition of a fresh
emulsion of yeast cells to a glowing <i>Cypridina</i> secretion
is sufficient to rapidly extinguish the light, because the
yeast is capable of utilizing the last trace of oxygen in the
mixture. Light only appears when, by agitation, we cause
more air to dissolve. The minimal concentration of oxygen
for luminescence of <i>Cypridina</i> lies somewhere between
3.04 mm. and the amount which living yeast fails to
extract from solution, a concentration approaching zero.
It is probably nearer the latter figure.</p>

<p>As the oxygen pressure is increased from 0 to about
7 mm., the intensity of the <i>Cypridina</i> luminescence increases
and at the latter figure the light is just as bright
as if the solution were saturated with air (152 mm.O<sub>2</sub>).
Thus, the luminescence requires only a low pressure of
oxygen and the similarity to the saturation of h&aelig;moglobin
with oxygen is obvious. Just as h&aelig;moglobin is nearly
saturated with oxygen at low pressures and becomes
bright red in color, so the luminous material becomes
saturated with oxygen at low pressures and
glows intensely.</p>

<p>Boyle also made many experiments to show that air
was necessary for the life of animals and the germination<!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of seeds and showed that repeatedly respired air was
unfit for further breathing. About the same time R. Hooke
discovered the true meaning of respiratory movements
and by forcing a blast of air continuously through the
lungs with bellows, was able to keep animals alive. He
concludes "that as the bare Motion of the <i>Lungs</i>, without
fresh air, contributes nothing to the life of the Animal, he
being found to survive as well as when they were not
moved as when they were; so it was not the Subsiding
or Movelessness of the <i>Lungs</i> that was the immediate
cause of death, or the stopping of the circulation of the
Blood through the <i>Lungs</i>, but the Want of a sufficient
Supply of fresh Air." The cause of death on collapse
of the lungs could not be better stated to-day. Thus combustion,
respiration and luminescence of flesh or wood
were early recognized as related phenomena.</p>

<p>Although the "gas sylvestre" (CO<sub>2</sub>) of burning charcoal
and fermentation of wine was known to van Helmont
(1577-1644) and Mayow (1646-1679) in 1674 showed that
"spiritus nitro&aelig;rens" (oxygen) was responsible for the
life of animals and for combustion, a century elapsed
before the true significance of these gases became known.
In the meantime the phlogiston theory of combustion had
been developed, Black (1728-1799) in 1755 had rediscovered
carbon dioxide ("fixed air") in the expired air and
Priestley (1733-1804) and Scheele (1742-1786) had both
rediscovered oxygen ("dephlogisticated air") in 1774.
About the same time Lavoisier overthrew the phlogiston
doctrine and showed that in the combustion of organic substances
water and CO<sub>2</sub> are formed.</p>

<p>Later it was realized that this slow combustion did
not take place in the lungs, or in the blood, but in the<!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
tissues cells themselves and respiration in the chemical
sense has come to mean this universal slow combustion
in the cells of the body rather than the breathing movements
of the lungs themselves. In anaerobic respiration,
CO<sub>2</sub> is given off, but no oxygen absorbed. In aerobic
respiration, oxygen is absorbed and CO<sub>2</sub> given off. In
addition we know of many substances which oxidize by taking
up oxygen without giving off CO<sub>2</sub>. We have seen that
oxygen must be absorbed for luminescence of animals and
we may now inquire whether CO<sub>2</sub> is given off and the relation
between respiration and light production.</p>

<p>To determine if CO<sub>2</sub> is given off during luminescence it
is necessary to work with fairly pure luminous materials,
obtained from luminous organisms. It is impossible to
use the living organisms themselves as the CO<sub>2</sub> continually
respired becomes a very disturbing factor. From <i>Cypridina</i>,
a small crustacean, two materials soluble in water
may be prepared (<i>luciferin</i> and <i>luciferase</i>), which will
give a brilliant luminescence on mixing. It is possible to
determine the H-ion concentration of the two solutions
separately and of the mixture of the two after the luminescence
has occurred.</p>

<p>If CO<sub>2</sub> is produced during luminescence the H-ion concentration
of the luminous solution should increase. Measurements
made electrometrically with the hydrogen electrode
have failed to demonstrate any increase in acidity.
The <span class="smcap">Ph</span> of both solutions and of a mixture of the two is
9.04. This would indicate that CO<sub>2</sub> is not produced. As
both luminous solutions contain proteins and the luminous
substances themselves are probably proteins, which have
a high buffer value, a method of this kind is none too sensitive.
However, we can definitely state that not enough<!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
CO<sub>2</sub> is produced to be detected and that this may be due
to the buffer action of the luminous substances themselves.
After all, unless luminescence is connected with respiration,
we should hardly expect CO<sub>2</sub> to be produced.</p>

<p>Another method of testing CO<sub>2</sub> production is to measure
the amount of heat produced during luminescence.
Substances burned during respiration give off considerable
heat, one gram of glucose to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, as much as
4000 calories. We have seen in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a> that no infra-red
radiation is produced in the light of the firefly. This
does not mean, however, that no heat is produced by the
reaction which produces the luminescence. A temperature
change of a few thousandths or hundredths of a
degree would evolve no measurable radiation. Coblentz
(1912) first studied the problem of heat production in
the firefly, using a thermocouple as the measuring instrument.
He came to the conclusion that the temperature
of the insect was slightly lower than the temperature of
the air and that the luminous segments were slightly
hotter than the non-luminous segments, whereas a dead
firefly is of the same temperature as its surroundings.
No definite increase or decrease in temperature could be
established during the flash of the firefly. However, further
work on the firefly is much to be desired.</p>

<p>The use of a living animal for such measurements introduces
a possible source of error in that any contraction
of the muscles of the animal will produce heat which
may add to an increase or mask a decrease of temperature
during luminescence. Utilization of extracts of luminous
animals containing the luciferin and luciferase mentioned
above avoids the complications due to muscular contraction.
By bringing the solutions of luciferin and luciferase<!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
to the same temperature and then mixing them one can
measure any increase or decrease of temperature which
occurs during the luminescence which results from mixing.
We can thus gain some idea of the heat of oxidation
of luciferin.</p>

<p>As a determination of heat production is of considerable
interest the method will be given in some detail.
Although the experiment sounds very simple, it is actually
somewhat difficult to carry out. The attainment of temperature
equilibrium between two solutions is very slow
when one wishes to obtain them to within 0.001&#0176; C.
of the same temperature. After many attempts, the following
arrangement of apparatus (<a href="#FIG_33">Fig. 33</a>) was found
most satisfactory. About 10 c.c. luciferin solution was
placed in the inner tube (<i>D</i>) of a special non-silvered
thermos bottle (<i>A</i>). About 1 c.c. of luciferase solution was
placed in a very thin-walled glass tube (<i>E</i>) which was
immersed in the luciferin solution and connected with a
small motor so that it could be slowly but constantly
rotated, thus stirring the solutions. Thermocouples (<i>L</i>
and <i>M</i>) of advance (.008 in)&mdash;copper (No. 30, <i>B</i> and <i>S</i>,
enamel insulated) wire were paraffined and placed in each
tube and the copper wires connected through a copper
double throw switch (<i>C</i>) with a Leeds and Northrup
d'Arsonval wall galvanometer (No. 34637, silver strip
suspension) of 35 ohms resistance and 310 megohms sensitivity.
The constant temperature junctions (<i>N</i>) were
placed in a large Dewar flask (<i>B</i>) filled with water at
approximately the same temperature as the luciferin
solution. One mm. galvanometer scale division represented
0.003&#0176; C. and the division readings could be estimated
to tenths. By means of a glass rod (<i>F</i>) placed in<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the tube containing luciferase solution, this tube could be
broken and the luciferase and luciferin solution mixed.</p>

<p>It was found that even after the luciferase and luciferin<!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
solutions came to the same temperature within the thermos
bottle, this was not necessarily the same as that of

thermocouple on the galvanometer scale were therefore
taken at one-minute intervals for some time before and
after mixing the luciferin and luciferase solutions and
plotted as curves. Control experiments were also carried
out in exactly the same manner as the luciferin-luciferase
experiments, but water was placed in the two tubes instead
of luciferin and luciferase. Figs. <a href="#FIG_34">34</a> and <a href="#FIG_35">35</a> give typical
experiments with water and with luminescent solutions,

<p>With both control (water) and luciferin experiments
there was a slight rise in temperature on mixing the liquids
in the two tubes. The average rise of five control (water)
experiments was .0054&#0176; C. and the average rise of five
luciferin experiments was .0048&#0176; C.<!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>The average rise in temperature is no doubt due to
heat from friction in mixing of the liquids and breaking
of the glass tube. The difference in the average rise of
control and of luciferin experiments is so small (.0006&#0176; C.)
as to have little significance. We may therefore conclude
that if any temperature change occurs during the luminescent
reaction it is certainly less than 0.001&#0176; C. and probably
less than 0.0005&#0176; C., too small to be measured by
this method.</p>

<p>To prepare the luciferin solution, two grams of dried
<i>Cypridina</i> were dissolved in 20 c.c. hot water and 10 c.c.
of this 10 per cent. solution was used in the thermos bottle
in the above experiments. If we assume that 1 per cent.
of the dried <i>Cypridina</i> is luciferin, 0.01 gram of luciferin
on oxidation was not able to raise the temperature of the
10 c.c. (in reality 11 c.c., since 1 c.c. luciferase solution
was mixed with the 10 c.c. luciferin solution) .001&#0176; C.
This means that 1 gram luciferin liberates <i>at least less</i>
than 10 calories during the luminescence accompanying
oxidation.</p>

<p>Since 1 gram glucose liberates 4000 calories on complete
oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, it will be seen that the
oxidation of luciferin is a very different type of reaction
from the oxidation of glucose. As we shall see, it is
probably similar to the oxidation of reduced h&aelig;moglobin
or the oxidation of leuco methylene-blue to methylene
blue. According to Barcroft and Hill (1910), 1.85 calories
are produced per gram of h&aelig;moglobin oxidized. I have
been unable to find figures for the heat exchange during
oxidation of leuco-dyes, but it is no doubt also small.
Since luciferin evolves no measurable amount of heat on
oxidation, we have very good evidence in support of that<!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
obtained by electrometric measurements of H-ion concentration,
that no carbon dioxide is produced during
luminescence of luminous animals.</p>

<p>In most animal cells it is perfectly clear that luminescence
does not accompany respiration, since respiration
is a continuous process, whereas light is only produced
on stimulation. It is true that on stimulation respiration
is accelerated, and we might suppose that luminescence is
an accompaniment of accelerated respiratory oxidations;
but this is not the case, for in luminous animals a rise in
temperature of ten degrees centigrade will accelerate
the respiratory oxidations 250 per cent. without necessarily
causing the production of light.</p>

<p>In fungi and bacteria, on the other hand, which continually
emit light, it is quite natural to suppose that the
light is an accompaniment of respiration, just as we
know the heat of these forms to be. This view was accepted
by such of the earlier workers as Fabre in 1855, who
found that luminous portions of a mushroom, <i>Agaricus
olearius</i>, gave off more CO<sub>2</sub> (4.41 c.c. CO<sub>2</sub> per gram in
36 hours at 12&#0176; C.) than non-luminous portions (2.88 c.c.
CO<sub>2</sub> per gram in 36 hours at 12&#0176; C.). This experiment has
never been repeated and there are many reasons besides
luminescence why one piece of fungus might have a more
rapid respiratory rate than another piece. It is not true
that rapidly respiring plant tissues, such as germinating
seeds or the spadix of <i>Arace&aelig;</i>, are luminous, although
they produce considerable heat.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is very easy to prove that luminescence,
even in bacteria, is not connected with respiration.
Thus, Beijerinck (1889 <i>c</i>) found that of several
species of luminous bacteria studied by him, one, <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
<i>Bacterium phosphorescens</i>, was a facultative ana&#0235;robe and
would grow, <i>i.e.</i>, multiply, but not luminesce in the absence
of oxygen. Some forms, ordinarily producing light, will
grow, but fail to luminesce at high temperatures. Beijerinck
(1915) has recently found that these individuals
may, by continued cultivation at high temperatures, form
non-luminous strains which fail to luminesce when again
brought into lower temperatures, favorable for luminescence.
These non-luminous mutants occasionally give rise
to atavistic brilliantly luminous forms. Beijerinck also
finds that after exposure of <i>Photobacter splendidum</i> to
ultra-violet or strong sunlight, radium or mesothorium
rays, luminescence continues but no growth occurs. There
is thus ample evidence that growth and respiration are
properties quite distinct and separable from luminescence.
Indeed, respiration increases continuously up to a relatively
high maximum whereas luminescence falls off rapidly
above a relatively low optimum. McKenney (1902)
found also that <i>Bacillus phosphorescens</i> could grow rapidly
in 0.5 per cent. ether without producing light.</p>

<p>Luminescence has been compared in bacteria to pigment
formation, as rather definite cultural conditions are
necessary for realization of both chromogenic and photogenic
function. Some pigment-formers, as <i>Bacillus pyocyaneus</i>,
which produces a water-soluble green pigment,
remain colorless under ana&#0235;robic conditions. A colorless
chromogen is formed, which oxidizes to the green pigment
in the air. If this colorless chromogen produced light
during its oxidation as well as green pigment, we would
have a case of both chromogenic and photogenic function
combined in one species of bacterium. Luminescence in<!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>volves
something more than respiration, an oxidation of
a very definite and particular kind.</p>

<p>Since Spallanzani's observation that the luminous
material of medus&aelig; could be dried, and upon moistening
would again give light, many confirmatory observations
have been made on other forms. <i>Pyrosoma</i>, <i>Pholas</i>, <i>Phyllirrho&#0235;</i>,
fireflies, <i>Pyrophorus</i>, copepods, ostracods, pennatulids,
fungi, and bacteria can all be dessicated and
the photogenic material preserved for a greater or less
time. In a dessicator filled with CaCl<sub>2</sub>, dried luminous
bacteria lose, after a few months, their power to give light
on being moistened. On the other hand, ostracods and
copepods will still luminesce after years of dessication.
The luminous material in the latter case appears capable
of indefinite preservation, but it is possible that the quick
loss of photogenic power with dried luminous bacteria
is merely an indication that they contain very little photogenic
substance and that the dried ostracods would also
in time lose their power to luminesce. It is certainly
a fact that the amount of luminous material in a single
gland cell of an ostracod is vastly greater than that in
the same mass of bacterial colony.</p>

<p>When the dried powdered luminous material of an
ostracod is sprinkled over the surface of water, it goes
into solution and leaves luminous diffusion and convection
trails plainly visible in the water. Many luminous
marine forms give off a phosphorescent slime when they
are handled, which adheres to the fingers. It is not surprising
that this luminous matter should have early received
a name. In 1872, Phipson called it <i>noctilucin</i> and
described some of its properties. He regarded the luminous
matter which can be scraped from dead fish (luminous<!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
bacteria) and the mucous secretion of <i>Scolopendra electrica</i>
or the luminous matter of the glowworm to be this
material, noctilucin, which, "in moist condition, takes up
oxygen and gives off CO<sub>2</sub> and when dry appears like
mucin." Phipson says that it forms an oily layer over the
seas in summer (he probably refers to masses of dinoflagellates),
is liquid at ordinary temperatures and less
dense than water, smells a little like caprylic acid, is
insoluble in water but miscible with it, insoluble in alcohol
and ether, dissolves with decomposition in mineral
acids and alkalies and contains no phosphorus. We can
see from this description that the word "noctilucin" does
not indicate a chemical individual, but it is the earliest
attempt to definitely designate the luminous substance.</p>

<p>The idea of a definite substance oxidizing and causing
the light has been upheld by a number of investigators,
and many years later Molisch called this substance the
<i>photogen</i>. He contrasts the "photogen theory" with
certain other views of light production, which may be
spoken of as "vital theories," notably those of Pfl&#0252;ger
(1875), who looked upon luminescence as a sign of intense
respiration, and of Beijerinck (1915), who regarded the
light as an accompaniment of the formation of living
matter from peptone.</p>

<p>Fortunately biological science has advanced beyond
the stage where a living process can be explained by
calling it a vital process, and we must fall back upon the
idea of a photogen oxidizing with light production. Indeed,
it is now possible to go much further than this
and describe the properties of the photogen, but we must
not lose sight of the fact that it was recognized very
early in the history of Bioluminescence, that water,<!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
oxygen, and a photogenic substance were necessary for
light production.</p>

<p>A very great advance in our knowledge of the chemistry
of the problem was made by Dubois in 1885. He
showed that if one dips the luminous organ of <i>Pyrophorus</i>
in hot water, the light disappears and will not return again.
Also if one grinds up a luminous organ the mass will
glow for some time but the light soon disappears. If one
brings the previously heated organ in contact with the
unheated triturated organ it will again give off light.
Later, Dubois showed that the same experiment could
be performed with the luminous tissues of <i>Pholas dactylus</i>.
A hot-water extract of the luminous tissue, and a
cold-water extract of the luminous tissue, allowed to stand
until the light disappears, will again produce light if mixed
together. Dubois (1887 <i>b</i>) advanced the theory that in
the hot-water extract there is a substance, luciferin, not
destroyed by heating, which oxidizes with light production
in the presence of an enzyme, luciferase, which is
destroyed on heating. The luciferase is present together
with luciferin in the cold-water extract, but the luciferin is
soon oxidized and luciferase alone remains. Mixing a
solution of luciferin and luciferase always results in light
production until the luciferin is again oxidized. Similar
substances have been found by me in the American fireflies,
<i>Photinus</i> and <i>Photuris</i>, the Japanese firefly, <i>Luciola</i>, and
in the ostracod crustacean, <i>Cypridina hilgendorfii</i>.
Crozier<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> reports that they exist also in <i>Ptychodera</i>, a
balanoglossid. I have been unable to demonstrate their
existence in luminous bacteria; in the annelid, <i>Ch&aelig;topterus</i>;
the pennatulids, <i>Cavernularia</i> and <i>Pennatula</i>; the<!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
squid, <i>Watasenia</i>; and the fish, <i>Monocentris japonica</i>.
E. B. Harvey (1917) could not demonstrate them in
<i>Noctiluca</i>. There are several reasons why the existence
of such bodies might be difficult to demonstrate, but these
reasons cannot be considered here. We thus see that the
photogen is in reality of dual nature, that two substances
are necessary for light production and that they may be
very readily separated because of difference in resistance
to heating. In this respect Bioluminescence is similar to
some other biological processes, notably to certain immune
reactions and to certain enzyme actions.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Private communication.</p></div>

<p>Thus, for the h&aelig;molysis of foreign red blood corpuscles,
a specific immune body (<i>amboceptor or substance
sensibilatrice</i>) not destroyed by moderate heating, and a
thermolabile complement (<i>alexin</i>) are necessary.</p>

<p>For the alcoholic fermentation of glucose by the zymase
of yeast juice two substances are also necessary. The
zymase is made up of a heat resistant, dialyzing component,
the co-enzyme, and a non-dialyzing substance,
destroyed on boiling, the enzyme proper. Both must be
present for alcoholic fermentation of glucose to proceed
and the two may be separated by dialysis or by their difference
in resistance to heating. Several other characteristics
of living cells are known to depend on the joint action
of two substances, one thermolabile, the other thermostable.
The reducing action of tissues, according to
Bach, requires a reducing enzyme proper or perhydridase
and some easily oxidizable substance, such as an aldehyde.
The aldehyde has been spoken of as the co-enzyme.</p>

<p>Because of the necessity of thermostable and thermolabile
substances for light production in luminous animals
and because I was unable to oxidize the thermostable<!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
material of <i>Cypridina</i> with such oxidizing agents as
KMnO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, blood and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BaO<sub>2</sub>, etc., I called the
heat resistant substance of <i>Cypridina</i>, "<i>photophelein</i>"
(from <i>phos</i>, light and <i>opheleo</i>, to assist), comparable to
co-zymase, and the heat sensitive substance of <i>Cypridina</i>,
"photogenin" (from <i>phos</i>, light and <i>gennao</i>, to produce),
comparable to the zymase proper of yeast. In mode of
preparation and properties, the photophelein of <i>Cypridina</i>
was also comparable to the luciferin of <i>Pholas</i> and
the <i>photogenin</i> of <i>Cypridina</i> to the luciferase of <i>Pholas</i>. I
also regarded photogenin as the source of the light (hence
the name), because a solution of <i>Cypridina</i> photogenin
(=<i>Pholas</i> luciferase) will give light on mixing with crystals
of salt and other substances which could not possibly
be oxidized. I later found, however, that this result was
due to the fact that the photogenin solution contained some
of the thermostable substance (luciferin) bound (combined
or adsorbed), and that this was freed by the salt
crystals and oxidized with light production. I have consequently
abandoned the view that the system of substances
concerned in light production is similar to the zymase&mdash;co-zymase
system of yeast&mdash;and have adopted Dubois'
term, luciferase (=<i>photogenin</i>) for the thermolabile material,
and luciferin (=<i>photophelein</i>) for the thermostable
material.</p>

<p>The luciferin of <i>Cypridina</i> differs from that of <i>Pholas</i>
in that it will not oxidize with light production with any
oxidizing agents that I have tried, and will give no light
with luciferase from <i>Pholas</i>. It does, however, oxidize
spontaneously in solution, although no light accompanies
this oxidation.</p>

<p>I believe that for accuracy and definiteness we must<!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
designate the luciferins and luciferases from different
animals by prefixing the generic name of the animal and
speak of <i>Pholas</i> luciferin, <i>Cypridina</i> luciferase, <i>Pyrophorus</i>
luciferase, etc. In extracts of many non-luminous
animals Dubois has found oxidizing agents which can
oxidize <i>Pholas</i> luciferin with light production and I have
confirmed this for <i>Pholas</i>, but I have not found any such
substances in non-luminous animals which will oxidize
<i>Cypridina</i> luciferin with light production. I have found
in extracts of non-luminous animals substances which will
liberate the bound luciferin in a concentrated <i>Cypridina</i>
luciferase solution. The luciferin can then be oxidized
by the luciferase and light appears. Their effect is similar
to that of salt crystals and I suggest that they be called
<i>photopheleins</i>, substances that assist in the luciferin-luciferase
reaction by liberating bound luciferin. One of the
best ways of freeing a solution of luciferase from bound
luciferin is to shake with chloroform. We can then do
away with the disturbing effects of bound luciferin.</p>

<p>It is obvious that luciferin must be formed from some
precursor in the cell and following the usual biochemical
terminology, Dubois has called it <i>proluciferin</i> or <i>preluciferin</i>,
and believes that it is converted into luciferin by
an enzyme co-luciferase. The experiments to prove the
existence of proluciferin were first made by Dubois on
<i>Pholas</i> in 1907 and have since been amplified (1917 <i>a</i>;
1918 <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>In order to understand these experiments it must be
borne in mind that Dubois prepares luciferin from <i>Pholas</i>
in three ways: (1) By precipitating the viscid luminous
fluid from the siphons with 95&#0176; alcohol and dissolving the
precipitate in water (1901<i>a</i>, 1907). (2) By extracting<!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the luminous organs with 90&#0176; alcohol in a closed vessel for
twelve hours and filtering (1896). (3) By heating the
viscid luminous fluid to 70&#0176; C. Apparently <i>Pholas</i>
luciferin is sparingly soluble in alcohol as it can be obtained
either in an alcoholic extract (method 2) or by
precipitation with alcohol (method 1). Proluciferin
(called <i>preluciferine</i> in a later paper, 1917 <i>a</i>, 1918 <i>a</i>), is
prepared by methods 1 or 2 except that fatigued siphons,
from which luciferin has been removed by washing, are
used (1907, 1917 <i>a</i>, 1918 <i>a</i>). Preluciferin can also be
obtained on boiling an extract of the luminous organ of
<i>Pholas</i> because luciferin (at 70&#0176;), luciferase (at 60&#0176;)
and a co-luciferase are all destroyed below the boiling
point (1917 <i>a</i>).</p>

<p>Co-luciferase is prepared (1) by heating a luciferase
solution to 65&#0176; (1917 <i>a</i>) or (2) by extracting with water
portions of the siphon of <i>Pholas</i> which have previously
been macerated and well extracted with alcohol (1918 <i>a</i>).
Long-continued treatment with alcohol apparently destroys
the luciferase without affecting the co-luciferase.
On mixing a solution of preluciferin with one of co-luciferase
and allowing them to stand for 8-10 hours, luciferase
is formed and can be recognized by the fact that it will
give light with a crystal of KMnO<sub>4</sub>. Preluciferine does
not do this.</p>

<p>Recently Dubois (1918 <i>a</i>) states that preluciferine is
nothing but taurine and that taurine occurs in large quantities
in <i>Pholas</i> and is transformed into luciferine by the
action of co-luciferase. Not only taurine, but also Byla's
peptone, egg lecithin, and esculin can be converted into
luciferine by co-luciferase, and since esculin, a glucoside,
is so transformed, Dubois believes this proves that co<!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>-luciferase
belongs to the hydrolases. Indeed, it proves
too much. Luciferin must have an extraordinary chemical
structure if it can be formed by hydrolysis of such diverse
compounds as peptone, lecithin, esculin and taurine. A
glance at the structural formula of esculin and taurine is
sufficient to emphasize the diverse nature of these
two substances.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Taurine &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Esculin</b></p>
</div>

<p>I believe that in these experiments Dubois has been
working with an oxidation product of luciferin, what I
have called <i>oxyluciferin</i>, rather than a pro-substance. The
mode of preparation of <i>Pholas</i> preluciferin and <i>Pholas</i>
co-luciferase is such as could be used in the preparation
of <i>Cypridina</i> oxyluciferin, and it seems more logical to
look for the presence of <i>Pholas</i> oxyluciferin in one or both
of Dubois' extracts rather than believe that luciferin can
be formed from both taurine and esculin. When the co-luciferase
solution stands with the preluciferin solution
we would in reality have not the formation of luciferin
from preluciferin, but the formation of luciferin from
oxyluciferin, by some reducing agent in the mixture.
Indeed, in a very recent paper Dubois (1919<i>c</i>) takes the<!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
view that his co-luciferase is a reducing enzyme which
forms luciferin by reduction (presumably from oxidized
luciferin) and no mention is made of preluciferin.</p>

<p>It is, of course, obvious that when luciferin oxidizes,
some oxidation products must be formed. Most observers
have assumed the oxidation products of luciferin to be
relatively simple and to represent a rather complete
breaking down of the luciferin molecule. Carbon dioxide
was mentioned by Phipson (1872) as being formed. We
have just seen that no carbon dioxide is formed during
the oxidation of <i>Cypridina</i> luciferin and there is evidence
that no fundamental change at all occurs. It is for this
reason that I have called the oxidation product of luciferin
<i>oxyluciferin</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> As we shall later see, the change luciferin
oxyluciferin is to be compared to the oxidation of colorless
dyes (leuco-compounds) to the colored dye. The
chemical properties of oxyluciferin are similar to those of
luciferin and the oxyluciferin can be readily reduced
to luciferin again.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> is unfortunate that Dubois (1918 b) has used the term
oxyluciferine in a quite different sense from the present use. He
regards oxyluciferine as a substance still capable of giving light by
auto&#0246;xidation, and represents the steps in luminescence as follows:</p>

<p>I should represent them as follows:</p>

<p class="center">Luciferin + oxygen <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> oxyluciferin.</p>

<p>The reaction proceeds to right with light production only in presence of
luciferase.</p></div>

<p>Finally, we have the fluorescent substance of <i>Pyrophorus</i>
and fireflies, which Dubois first called <i>pyrophorin</i>,<!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
but later, adopting McDermott's terminology, speaks of
as <i>luciferesceine</i>. This Dubois regards as a substance
intensifying the light and modifying its color by changing
invisible into visible rays. As we have seen, this
theory, while attractive, will not stand the test of
critical examination.</p>

<p>Phipson's noctilucin, while the first name for the photogen
of luminous animals, is too vague a substance, chemically,
to warrant a retention of the term. Of the names,
luciferin, luciferase, preluciferin or proluciferin, co-luciferase,
photogenin, photophelein, oxyluciferin, luciferesceine,
I believe that only proluciferin, luciferin, oxyluciferin,
luciferase and photophelein stand for substances
which are really significant for the theory of light production.
<i>Luciferin</i> is the heat resistant, dialyzable substance
which takes up oxygen and oxidizes with light production
in the presence of the heat sensitive, non-dialyzing,
enzyme-like <i>luciferase</i>. The luciferin must come from
some precursor, <i>proluciferin</i>, but I have been unable to
demonstrate the existence of this body in <i>Cypridina</i> and
know nothing definite of its properties. The luciferin
oxidizes to <i>oxyluciferin</i> which has the same chemical properties
as the luciferin itself and may be reduced to luciferin
again by reducing substances in luminous and other
animals or by inorganic reducing agents. <i>Photophelein</i>
is a name for substances in various animal or plant
extracts which are capable of liberating luciferin from
some bound condition in solutions containing luciferase.
Under this term are included a number of unknown,
probably quite different substances, some of which are
thermostable and others thermolabile.</p>

<p>We have seen that Bioluminescence is an oxylumines<!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>cence,
that the light is probably due to the oxidation of
a compound, luciferin, in presence of air and water and
that the oxidation is accelerated by an enzyme-like substance,
luciferase. We also saw in <a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chapter 2</a> that light
production is of fairly common occurrence during the
oxidation of many organic compounds, provided the oxidation
is carried out in the proper way. Many of these
organic compounds must be oxidized by relatively strong
alkali or such strong oxidizing agents as would have a
very deleterious action on living cells. In 1913, Ville and
Derrien, in a short note to the French Academy, "Catalyse
Biochemique d'une Oxydation Luminescente," show that
<i>lophin</i> could be oxidized by vertebrate blood in the presence
of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In the same year Dubois (1913) found
that esculin, the glucoside from horse chestnut bark, would
also oxidize and luminesce in presence of blood and
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In these cases the h&aelig;moglobin of the blood acts as
a catalyst, transferring oxygen from the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to esculin
or lophin and is to be compared to luciferase, except that
luciferase does not require the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>As the h&aelig;moglobin does not lose this power on boiling,
whereas luciferase does, the analogy is far from perfect.
Many oxygen carriers are known, however, which may
be destroyed on boiling their solutions, namely, the peroxidases
of plant juices. Esculin will not luminesce with
peroxidase and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but pyrogallol or gallic acid will.
If one mixes a test tube containing pyrogallol solution +
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with potato or turnip juice or almost any plant extract,
a yellowish luminescence appears. The plant extract
loses the power to cause such luminescence on boiling and
the peroxidase will not dialyze. It is, of course, comparable
to luciferase and acts on the thermostable, dialyz<!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>able
pyrogallol-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mixture, which is comparable to
luciferin. Curiously enough, although many hydroxyphenol
and amino-phenol compounds can be oxidized by
peroxidase and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, only pyrogallol and gallic acid will
oxidize with light production. Many other oxidizers can
take the place of the peroxidase. A list of these is given
on <a href="#Page_151">page 151</a>. No other peroxide can take the place of
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with peroxidases as oxidizers, but a few can replace
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with other oxidizers. This is brought out in <a href="#Table_7">Table 7</a>.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the existence of such analogous,
purely organic chemical oxidations, which proceed with
light production, greatly strengthens Dubois' theory that<!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the luciferin-luciferase reaction really represents a catalytic
oxidation of similar nature. As Dubois (1914 <i>a</i>)
expresses it, we are dealing in luminous organisms with
"1&#0176; une luminescence; 2&#0176; une chemiluminescence; 3&#0176; une
oxyluminescence; 4&#0176; une zymoluminescence.</p>

<p>"Ou si l'on bien admettre que les zymases sont encore
quelque chose de vivant, une Biozymo&#0246;xyluminescence."
Perhaps it is not really necessary to admit that the enzymes
are living in order that we may adequately visualize
the nature of the photogenic process.</p>

<p>In the next chapter the properties of the three principal
substances, luciferin, oxyluciferin and luciferase, will be
studied more carefully.<!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI
<br />
THE CHEMISTRY OF LIGHT PRODUCTION, PART II</h2>


<p>Since Radziszewski's experiments on the oxidation of
oils in alcoholic solutions of alkali, most of the early
workers on Bioluminescence tacitly assumed that the oxidizable
material was fat or a fat-like substance. Support
was given to this view by the occurrence in cells of
granules or globules from which the light was seen to come.
We now know that these bodies are not fat droplets and
that neither luciferin nor luciferase are soluble in such fat
solvents as ether, chloroform, benzol or benzine. Phipson's
description of the properties of noctilucin are too
crude and inaccurate to be considered. Dubois did not
study the chemical properties of luciferin and luciferase
from <i>Pyrophorus</i>, the first form with which he worked,
except to point out that <i>Pyrophorus</i> luciferase was destroyed
on heating and was precipitated by alcohol while
the <i>Pyrophorus</i> luciferin was not so affected. Luciferin
was found only in the luminous organ of <i>Pyrophorus</i>, not
in the blood; luciferase probably exists throughout
the animal.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Private communication from R. Dubois.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pholas luciferin.</span>&mdash;In a series of papers since 1887
Dubois has studied the chemical properties of <i>Pholas</i>
luciferin and <i>Pholas</i> luciferase. He finds the luciferin
to be destroyed above 70&#0176; C., to dialyze slowly, to oxidize
with light production in the presence of <i>Pholas</i> luciferase,
KMnO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, h&aelig;matine and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BaO<sub>2</sub>, PbO<sub>2</sub>, hypochlorites,
and the blood of various marine mollusks and crus<!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>tacea.
It is insoluble in fat solvents but forms a colloidal
solution in water from which it is precipitated unchanged
by picric acid, alcohol at 82&#0176;, and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. It is not
precipitated by NaCl, MgSO<sub>4</sub> or acetic and carbonic acids,
except in presence of neutral salts. It forms an insoluble
alkali albumin with NH<sub>4</sub>OH. Dubois (1887 <i>a</i>) stated
at one time that it could be crystallized and has spoken
of it as belonging to several different classes of substances,
proteose, nucleoprotein, albumin. Most recently he describes
luciferin as a natural albumin having acid properties.
It occurs only in luminous, not in non-luminous animals,
and is found in all parts of the mantle, especially
the siphons. It does not occur in non-luminous parts of
the mollusk. No photographs of luciferin crystals have
ever been published.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pholas luciferase.</span>&mdash;<i>Pholas</i> luciferase has all the
properties of an enzyme, is destroyed at 60&#0176; C., is non-dialyzable,
insoluble in fat solvents, but forms a colloidal
solution in water. It is not affected by 1 per cent. NaF
but its activity is suspended in saturated salt solutions,
sugar or glycerine, and it may be preserved in this way,
its activity returning on dilution. It is digested by trypsin
and slowly destroyed by the fat solvent an&aelig;sthetics,
such as chloroform. For this reason Dubois regards it as
an oxidizing enzyme similar to the oxydones of Batelli and
Stern. Because he found iron in an extract of <i>Pholas</i>
dialyzed for a long time against running water, Dubois
considers that it is associated with iron, and reports that
it will oxidize the ordinary oxidase reagents, such as
pyrogallol, gum guaiac, a-naphthol and para-phenylene-diamine,
etc. It remains to be proved, however, that
luciferase and not the oxidizing systems such as occur in<!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
all cells are responsible for the coloration of these reagents.
Dubois has found luciferases or substances capable
of giving light with <i>Pholas</i> luciferin in the blood of
many non-luminous crustacea and mollusks (in <i>Barnea
candida</i>, <i>Solen</i>, <i>Cardium edulis</i>, <i>Ostr&aelig;a</i> and <i>Mytilus</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypridina luciferin</span>.&mdash;Despite the large amount that
has been written on luminous animals, Dubois' work on
<i>Pholas</i> and my own on <i>Cypridina</i> and the firefly are the
only truly chemical studies that give us any idea of the
nature of the photogenic substances in any luminous animal.
In many ways <i>Cypridina</i> luciferin is similar to
<i>Pholas</i> luciferin, but the two differ in a sufficient number
of points to make certain that they are not identical substances.
As I have emphasized above, we should speak
not of luciferin and luciferase but of the <i>luciferins</i> and
the <i>luciferases</i>. The luciferins, as the oxidizable substances,
must claim first attention. They are more simple
substances than the luciferases. If we are to produce
light artificially in the same way that animals do, the
luciferins must be synthesized. The luciferin of <i>Pholas</i>
will luminesce with KMnO<sub>4</sub> and other oxidizing agents,
and, although I have not yet succeeded in oxidizing <i>Cypridina</i>
luciferin with oxidizing agents, I have no doubt
but that some inorganic catalyzer will be found to take
the place of luciferase and accelerate oxidation of <i>Cypridina</i>
luciferin with light production.</p>

<p>The most remarkable peculiarity of <i>Cypridina</i> luciferin
is its stability. In my first paper on <i>Cypridina</i> I stated
that luciferin was not destroyed by momentary boiling but
would be destroyed if boiled four or five minutes; also,
that it was unstable at room temperatures and would disappear
from solution in the course of a day or so. The<!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
reason for this is that luciferin oxidizes even in absence
of luciferase and will then no longer give light with luciferase.
This spontaneous oxidation, which occurs without
light production, can be prevented by keeping the luciferin
in a hydrogen atmosphere or by the addition of acid.
Under these conditions the luciferin can be boiled without
destruction or preserved for months without deterioration.
The rapid disappearance of luciferin from neutral
or alkaline solution on boiling in the air is entirely due
to the more rapid oxidation at the boiling point. As the
oxidation product, oxyluciferin, can be readily reconverted
into luciferin again, we can not consider luciferin
unstable in the sense that its molecule is actually destroyed
as is the case when luciferase is boiled.</p>

<p>Not only is luciferin stable on boiling but it will
actually withstand boiling for 10 hours with 20 per cent.
HCl (by weight, sp. gr. = 1.1) or with 4 per cent. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
After one day of boiling with 20 per cent. HCl the luciferin
was completely destroyed and with 4 per cent. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
destruction was almost complete. In these cases there
was no question of a mere oxidation to oxyluciferin, as
no oxyluciferin could be demonstrated after boiling with
such strong acids. An actual destruction, probably an
hydrolysis of the luciferin molecule, occurred. We shall
have occasion to refer to this again in considering the
protein nature of luciferin. It must be borne in mind
that many proteins require four or five days' boiling with
20 per cent. HCl for complete hydrolysis to amino-acids.
Luciferin forms a solution in water, probably colloidal,
although the luciferin will dialyze through parchment
or collodion membranes. It is rather readily adsorbed
by various finely divided materials such as bone black,<!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub>, kaolin, talc and CaCo<sub>3</sub>. It is not destroyed
by any of the enzyme solutions which I have tried. These
include such as are widely divergent in action: pepsin
HCl, trypsin, erepsin, salivary and malt diastase, yeast
invertase, urease, rennin and the enzymes of dried spleen,
kidney and liver substances.</p>

<p>By extracting the dried Cypridinas ground to a powder,
the solubility of luciferin in non-aqueous solvents
could be easily studied, and by adding such reagents as
dilute acids, alkalies, neutral salts and the alkaloidal reagents
to an aqueous solution of luciferin the general biochemical
behavior of luciferin can be quite accurately
stated. For convenience the results of this study are
given in <a href="#Table_8">Table 8</a>.</p>

<p>Because the luciferin is almost completely precipitated
by saturation with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, we may conclude that it
occurs in water in the colloidal state. This excludes it
from belonging to one of the numerous groups of biochemical
compounds occurring in true solution and places
it among the known groups of colloidal substances, the
soaps, proteins, polysaccharides, phospholipins, galactolipins
(<i>cerebrosides</i>), tannins or saponins. It is not a
polysaccharide because nearly completely precipitated by
phosphotungstic acid, nor a soap because not precipitated
by calcium salts, nor a phospho- or galactolipin because
insoluble in benzine, hot or cold. It gives no tannin or
saponin tests. Only the protein group remains, and of
the eighteen protein classes recognized by the American
Society of Biochemists, the general properties of luciferin
indicate that it should be placed among the natural
proteoses, somewhere on the borderland between the proteoses
and peptones. The fact that luciferin will dialyze,
although almost completely salted out by (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, is
strong evidence in favor of placing it in such a position.</p>

<p>On the other hand, luciferin has two properties which
to say the least are unusual for proteins. I refer to its<!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
solubility in alcohols, acetone, esters, etc., and non-digestibility
by trypsin or erepsin, which have almost universal
proteolytic power.</p>

<p>The best known class of proteins soluble in alcohol is
the prolamines of plants, but the prolamines are insoluble
in water and in absolute alcohol. Zein, the prolamine of
corn, is soluble in 90 per cent. ethyl, methyl, and propyl
alcohols, in glycerol heated to 150&#0176; C., and in glacial acetic
acid. Recently Osborne and Wakeman (1918) have described
a protein from milk having solubilities similar
to those of gliadin, the prolamine of wheat. Welker
(1912) has described a substance, obtained from Witte's
peptone, giving the biuret, Millon, and Hopkins-Cole tests,
which is soluble in water and absolute alcohol but not in
ether, and it is possible that others of the peptones are
soluble in absolute alcohol. On the other hand, some
proteins in the absence of salts form colloidal solutions
in strong alcohol from which they may be precipitated by
an appropriate salt. As the absolute alcohol extract of
<i>Cypridin&aelig;</i> was made from dry material containing the
salts of sea water, some salt was present, but there is
always the possibility of sol formation.</p>

<p>If we extract dried <i>Cypridin&aelig;</i>, which have previously
been thoroughly extracted with benzine or ether, with
800 c.c. of boiling absolute alcohol for an hour, filter
the alcohol extract through blotting paper and hardened
filter paper, quickly evaporate the filtrate to dryness
on the water bath, and dissolve the residue in a small
quantity of water saturated with CO<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> we obtain a
yellow opalescent solution which gives a bright light
with luciferase. This solution contains some protein<!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
or protein derivatives as it gives a very faint Millon
reaction, a good positive ninhydrin test, reddish blue in
color, but no biuret reaction. It precipitates with tannic
and phosphotungstic acids but not with picric, acetic,
trichloracetic, or chromic acids. The extract gives a
faint Molisch reaction for carbohydrates. As the evidence
points to the presence of some protein products in the
absolute alcohol extract of <i>Cypridin&aelig;</i>, it is possible that
this protein is luciferin. It should be emphasized, however,
that the Millon reaction was very faint, although the
ninhydrin was quite marked and the biuret negative.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> To make the solution slightly acid and prevent oxidation of the
luciferin.</p></div>

<p>Although luciferin is not digested by trypsin, even
after five days at 38&#0176; C., it does hydrolyze with mineral
acids after about 16 hours' boiling. Some proteins, the
albuminoids and racemized proteins, resist tryptic digestion
but yield to acid hydrolysis. We know also that some
NH-CO linkages of proteins are broken down with great
difficulty by trypsin as it is difficult to obtain a tryptic
digest of protein which does not give the biuret reaction,
and the work of Fischer and Abderhalden has shown that
certain artificial polypeptides are not digested by pure
activated pancreatic juice.</p>

<p>We have, then, three possibilities: Luciferin is (1)
either a natural proteose not attacked by trypsin, or (2) if
attacked by trypsin its decomposition products (presumably
amino-acids) still contain the group oxidizable
with light production, or (3) it is not protein at all. I
have been unable to oxidize with light production various
mixtures of amino-acids (from tryptic digestion of
beef and casein, or the acid hydrolysis products of luciferin
itself) by means of luciferase, and consequently am
led to believe that <i>Cypridina</i> luciferin is either a new<!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
natural proteose, soluble in absolute alcohol and not
digested by trypsin or that it belongs to some other group
than the proteins. The absence of a biuret reaction would
point in that direction and the question must await
further study.</p>

<p><i>Cypridina</i> luciferin is found in the luminous gland of
the animal and possibly in parts non-luminous as well as
in the luminous organ. This is true of the luciferin from
fireflies which is found throughout the body of <i>Luciola</i>,
<i>Photuris</i> and <i>Photinus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cypridina luciferase.</span>&mdash;Luciferase, on the other hand,
has <i>all</i> the properties of a complex protein. It will not
dialyze through collodion or parchment membranes, is
soluble only in aqueous solvents, and hence precipitated by
alcohol and acetone, digested by proteolytic enzymes,
readily changed by contact with dilute acid and alkali and
irreversibly coagulated on boiling. It is completely salted
out of solution by saturation with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and nearly
completely precipitated by the alkaloidal reagents. Its
other properties are given in <a href="#Table_8">Table 8</a>. Taken together,
they point to the group of albumins as the class of proteins
with which luciferase most closely agrees.</p>

<p>If luciferase is not a protein it is so closely bound up
with protein that it cannot be separated. This is characteristic
of many enzymes and luciferase is also an enzyme.
We can determine this by finding out whether luciferase
will accelerate the oxidation of a large amount of luciferin,
for such is the test of a catalytic substance. If we take
1 c.c. of a dilute solution of luciferase (1 <i>Cypridina</i> to 50
c.c. water) and add to it successive 1 c.c. portions of concentrated
luciferin (1 <i>Cypridina</i> to 2 c.c. solution) as soon as
the light from the preceding addition has disappeared,<!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
after four 1 c.c. additions, no more light is produced. The
luciferase is therefore used up and cannot oxidize more
than a certain quantity of luciferin. In this experiment,
however, we added a concentration of luciferin from one
<i>Cypridina</i> 100 times that of the luciferase from one <i>Cypridina</i>,
i.e., four additions each 25 times as concentrated.
We have, of course, no way of telling what the absolute
amount (in milligrams) of luciferin or luciferase is in a
single <i>Cypridina</i>, but we do know that the luciferase from
one <i>Cypridina</i> cannot oxidize luciferin from more than 100
Cypridinas. If the ratio of luciferin to luciferase in a
single animal is 100:1, it would mean that luciferase
could oxidize 10,000 times its weight of luciferin. A large
excess of luciferin but not an indefinite quantity can be
oxidized by luciferase, and I believe this is sufficient justification
for considering luciferase an enzyme, although it is
not an ideal example of an organic catalyzer. Quite a number
of enzymes are known to be diminished during the
course of the reaction they accelerate or to be poisoned by
their reaction products. Enzyme reactions inhibited by
the formation of reaction products again proceed if these
are removed or diluted. However, light does not again
appear in a mixture of weak luciferase with excess of luciferin
upon dilution with water, so that the luciferase cannot
have been merely inhibited by some reaction product but
must have been actually used up during the reaction. It
should be noted in passing that the peroxidases, ordinarily
spoken of as oxidizing enzymes, are used up in the reaction
and can only oxidize limited amounts of oxidizable
substances, a quantity almost in proportion to the concentration
of peroxidase present.</p>

<p>Whether luciferase is an oxidizing enzyme made up of<!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
an albumin associated with some heavy metal as iron,
copper or manganese is uncertain. From analyses of
whole <i>Cypridina</i>, kindly made for me by Prof. A. H.
Phillips of Princeton University, all three of these metals,
which we know to be associated with biological oxidations,
are present, and it is quite possible that one of them is
concerned with the oxidation of luciferin.</p>

<p>Although I have tested a great many oxidizers, organic
and inorganic, and a large number of oxidizing enzymes
from blood and tissue extracts of animals rich in iron,
copper and manganese, I have found no material which
is capable of taking the place of <i>Cypridina</i> luciferase.
Peroxidases or oxidases of plants, h&aelig;moglobin, h&aelig;mocyanin,
extracts of mussels, manganese containing blood
of various marine crustacea and mollusks will give no light
on mixing with luciferin. Such active oxidizers as
KMnO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BaO<sub>2</sub>, and many others, will not oxidize
<i>Cypridina</i> luciferin with light production, although they
can oxidize <i>Pholas</i> luciferin with light production.</p>

<p>The action of <i>Cypridina</i> luciferase is very highly
specific. It is found only in the luminous organ of <i>Cypridina
hilgendorfii</i>, not in non-luminous parts and not
in a non-luminous species of <i>Cypridina</i> closely related
to <i>hilgendorfii</i>.</p>

<p>Luciferins and luciferases from closely allied luminous
forms will mutually interact to produce light, but no light
appears if these substances come from distantly related
forms. Thus firefly (<i>Photuris</i>) luciferin will give light
with <i>Pyrophorus</i> luciferase and <i>vice versa</i>, but <i>Cypridina</i>
luciferin will give no light with firefly (<i>Luciola</i>) luciferase
or <i>vice versa</i>, nor with <i>Pholas</i> luciferase or <i>vice versa</i>.
The faint luminescences sometimes observed on mixing<!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
firefly or <i>Cypridina</i> luciferase with boiled extracts of non-luminous
forms, or of distantly related luminous forms,
are probably caused by photophelein in the boiled extract.</p>

<p>Like the plant peroxidases, <i>Cypridina</i> luciferase is not
readily affected by the action of chloroform, toluol, etc.
Unlike the plant peroxidases, it will not oxidize (<i>i.e.</i>,
produce coloration) in either presence or absence of
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, any of the hydroxyphenol or aminophenol compounds,
such as pyrogallol, a-naphthol, para-diamino-benzine,
gum guaiac, etc., commonly used as peroxidase reagents.
Neither will luciferase produce light with any substances,
such as oils, lophin, pyrogallol, gallic acid, esculin,
etc., which we know to be capable of oxidation with
light production by other means. The luciferases are
very highly specific and act only upon the luciferins of the
same or closely related species. They must be placed by
themselves in a new class of oxidizing enzymes.</p>

<p>According to Dubois, <i>Pholas</i> luciferase is rather
readily destroyed by chloroform and my own observations
indicate that this is true also of firefly luciferase,
so that a certain amount of variation exists in the group
of luciferases.</p>

<p>None of the luminescent animals which I have studied
are at all affected by cyanides. The luminescence continues
in extracts of <i>Cypridina</i>, firefly, and <i>Cavernularia</i>,
or in <i>Noctiluca</i> and luminous bacteria after addition of
small or high (<i>m</i>/40) concentrations of KCN. In this
respect the luciferases are very different from many types
of oxidizing enzymes which are inhibited by exceedingly
weak concentrations of cyanide. It should be borne in
mind, however, that while KCN inhibits catalase and the<!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
catalytic decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by Pt or Ag, it does not
affect the catalytic decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by thallium.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oxyluciferin.</span>&mdash;When luciferin is oxidized it must be
converted into some substance or substances and I believe
this change involves no fundamental destruction of the
luciferin molecule as it is a reversible process. I shall
speak of the principal (if not the only) product formed
as <i>oxyluciferin</i>.</p>

<p>If we assume that the oxidation of luciferin changes the
molecule but slightly, we at once think of comparing the
change luciferin <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> oxyluciferin with the change reduced
h&aelig;moglobin <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> oxyh&aelig;moglobin. The condition is, however,
not so simple as this, for oxyh&aelig;moglobin will again
give up its oxygen providing the partial pressure of
oxygen is made sufficiently low, whereas oxyluciferin will
not do this, at least in the dark. We can not reduce oxyluciferin
solution by exhausting the oxygen with an
air-pump.</p>

<p>There is another oxidation-reduction system which can
also be easily reversed, but not by merely removing the
oxygen from the solution&mdash;that is, the reduction of a dye
such as methylene blue to its leuco-base. I believe the
change which occurs when luciferin is oxidized is similar
to that which occurs when the leuco-base of methylene
blue or sodium indigo-sulphonate is oxidized to the blue
dye. Oxidation of leuco-dye bases occurs spontaneously
in presence of oxygen and appears to consist in the removal
of hydrogen from the leuco-base with formation
of water. Reduction of these dyes may be effected in the
same ways that oxyluciferin can be reduced. In the case
of methylene blue, reduction consists in the addition of
two hydrogen atoms. Whether a similar change occurs<!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
when oxyluciferin is reduced or whether oxygen is actually
added as in formation of h&aelig;moglobin cannot be definitely
stated at present. We may write equations representing
these possibilities as follows:</p>

<p class="center">
C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>20</sub>N<sub>3</sub>SCl (leuco-methylene blue) + O <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>18</sub>N<sub>3</sub>SCl (methylene blue) + H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
</p>
<p class="center">
H&aelig;moglobin + O <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> oxyh&aelig;moglobin.<br />
</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the methods which may be used in
reduction of oxyluciferin. We may then endeavor to write
an equation which will represent the fundamental changes
in the luminescence reaction.</p>

<p>My attempts to reduce the oxidation product of luciferin
started from the observation that if one places a
clear solution of luciferase in a tall test tube, although
it may give off no light at first when shaken, after standing
a day or so a very bright light would appear on shaking.
This was especially true when the luciferase had become
turbid and ill-smelling from the growth of bacteria.
Thinking that the bacteria produced a substance which
could be oxidized by the luciferase, I tried growing bacteria
and also yeast on appropriate culture media, and
after some days of growth mixing the culture media containing
the products of bacterial or yeast growth with
luciferase, expecting to obtain light; but no light appeared.
However, if a little crude luciferase solution was added
to the bacterial or yeast cultures and then allowed to stand
for some hours, light appeared whenever they were
shaken. Indeed such cultures behaved much as a suspension
of luminous bacteria which has used up all the oxygen
in the culture fluid and will only luminesce when, by shaking,
more oxygen dissolves in the culture medium. Real<!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>izing
that in bacterial cultures in test tubes, ana&#0235;robic
conditions soon appear, and also the strong reducing
action of bacteria upon many substances (for instance,
nitrates or methylene blue) under ana&#0235;robic conditions,
it struck me that the bacteria might be reducing the oxidation
product of luciferin to luciferin again. We must
remember that since crude luciferase solution is a cold-water
extract of a luminous animal allowed to stand until
all the luciferin has been oxidized, it must contain oxyluciferin
as well as luciferase and will give light if
the oxyluciferin is again reduced and oxygen admitted.
This appears to be the correct explanation of
the above experiments.</p>

<p>Oxyluciferin may also be readily reduced by the use
of the blood of the horse-shoe crab (<i>Limulus</i>) allowed to
stand until bacteria develop. This experiment is of special
interest because the blood contains h&aelig;mocyanin, which is
colorless in the reduced condition and blue in the oxy-condition.
The color change thus serves as an indicator
of the oxygen concentration in the blood. A sample of
foul-smelling <i>Limulus</i> blood full of bacteria will become
colorless on standing in a test tube for 10 to 15 minutes, but
the blue color quickly returns if shaken with air. Such
a blood has the power of reducing oxyluciferin through the
activity of the bacteria which it contains. Fresh blood
has very little if any reducing action.</p>

<p>Not only bacteria but also tissue extracts have a strong
reducing action in absence of oxygen. Thus, muscle tissue
stained in methylene blue will very quickly decolorize
(reduce) the methylene blue if oxygen (air) is kept away,
but the blue color immediately returns if air is admitted.
Oxyluciferin (<i>i.e.</i>, a solution of luciferin which has been<!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
completely oxidized by boiling or standing in air until it no
longer gives light with luciferase) if mixed with a suspension
of ground frog's muscle and kept in a well-filled
and stoppered test tube for some hours, is reduced to
luciferin and gives a bright light if now poured into
luciferase solution. Frog muscle suspension alone, or
oxyluciferin alone, give no light with luciferase, nor will
a mixture of frog muscle suspension and oxyluciferin, if
shaken with air for several hours. Only if this last mixture
be kept under ana&#0235;robic conditions is the oxyluciferin
reduced.</p>

<p>The reducing action of tissues is said to be due to a
reducing enzyme (<i>reducase</i> or <i>reductase</i>), itself composed
of a perhydridase and some easily oxidized body such as
an aldehyde. In the presence of the perhydridase the
oxygen of water oxidizes the aldehyde and the hydrogen
set free reduces any easily reducible substance which may
be present. There is a perhydridase in fresh milk, spoken
of as <i>Schardinger's enzyme</i>, which is destroyed by boiling.
If some aldehyde is added, fresh milk will reduce
methylene blue to its leuco-base or nitrates to nitrites,
upon standing a short time. If shaken with air the blue
color returns. There is no reduction unless an aldehyde
is added or unless some boiled extract of a tissue such as
liver is added. The boiled-liver extract has no reducing
action of its own, but supplies a substance similar to the
aldehyde which has been spoken of as <i>co-enzyme</i>. The
aldehyde is oxidized to its corresponding acid. Milk will
reduce methylene blue without aldehyde if bacteria are
present in large numbers. There is no reduction if the
milk, methylene blue, and aldehyde are agitated with air.
The temperature optimum is rather high, 60&#0176; to 70&#0176; C.<!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>I find that milk is a favorable and convenient medium
for the reduction of oxyluciferin and that it acts without
the addition of an aldehyde or the presence of bacteria.
There is probably a substance acting as the aldehyde in
the luciferase-oxyluciferin solution. No light appears if
milk is added to a luciferase-oxyluciferin solution, but if
the mixture is allowed to stand in absence of oxygen light
will appear when air is admitted. The air can be conveniently
kept out by filling small test tubes completely
with the solution and closing them with rubber stoppers.</p>

<p>As almost all animal tissues contain reductases it is
not surprising to find that a freshly prepared and filtered
extract of <i>Cypridina</i> containing oxyluciferin and luciferase,
which gives no light on shaking, will, on standing
in a stoppered tube for 24 hours at room temperature in
the dark give light when air is admitted. While this
may be due to the development of bacteria with a reducing
action, it does not seem likely, as under the same conditions
methylene blue is not reduced in 24 hours, and
there is no turbidity or smell of decomposition in the
tube. In 48 hours bacteria appear and methylene blue
is also reduced. If we add chloroform, toluol or thymol
to the tubes of <i>Cypridina</i> extract to prevent the growth
of bacteria, and allow them to stand 48 hours, upon admitting
air the tube with chloroform gives no light but the
tubes with toluol and thymol do give light, although it
is not so bright as if they were absent. I believe that these
substances have a destructive action on the reductases,
most complete in the case of chloroform. Dubois (1919<i>c</i>)
also has recorded the occurrence of a reducing enzyme
in <i>Pholas</i>, a "hydrogenase," which is able to form hydrogen
from cane sugar, and luciferin from a boiled ex<!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>tract
of <i>Pholas</i>. He now regards it as identical with
his co-luciferase.</p>

<p>I have not been able to demonstrate that a <i>Cypridina</i>
extract will reduce methylene blue, or nitrates to nitrites,
either with or without the addition of acetaldehyde. This
may be due to the fact that oxyluciferin, which is also
present, may be reduced more readily than either nitrates
or methylene blue, and so is reduced first.</p>

<p>We can also reduce oxyluciferin by means which do not
involve the use of animal extracts. Perhaps the best of
these is reduction by palladium black and sodium hypophosphite.
The latter is oxidized in presence of palladium
and nascent hydrogen is set free. The nascent
hydrogen reduces any easily reducible substance which
may be present, such as methylene blue or oxyluciferin.
Oxyluciferin is not reduced by palladium alone or hypophosphite
alone, but methylene blue is reduced by palladium
black alone.</p>

<p>If hydrogen sulphide is passed through a solution of
methylene blue the dye is very quickly reduced and becomes
colorless. If the H<sub>2</sub>S is driven off by boiling the
colorless methylene-blue solution, the blue color again
returns on cooling. Oxyluciferin can also be reduced
by H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>

<p>If one adds some Mg powder to oxyluciferin and then
dilute acetic acid in successive additions as the acetic
acid is used up in formation of Mg acetate, the oxyluciferin
will be reduced relatively quickly. Nascent hydrogen
is produced in the reaction and is no doubt the active
reducing agent.</p>

<p>Dilute acid favors the reduction of oxyluciferin. If
<!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>one saturates an oxyluciferin solution with CO<sub>2</sub> or adds
a little dilute acetic acid, HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, to it, a certain
amount of reduction will occur. No reduction occurs
if the solution is saturated with pure hydrogen, even if
allowed to stand 24 hours. The action of the acid begins
when the solution of oxyluciferin, ordinarily slightly alkaline
(<span class="smcap">Ph</span> = 9), is made neutral (<span class="smcap">Ph</span> = 7.1) as indicated in
<a href="#Table_9">Table 9</a>. The action of the acid must be on the oxyluciferin,
as no luciferin or other enzymes destroyed on boiling
are present.</p>

<p>It is possible that the action of bacteria (which produces
CO<sub>2</sub>), muscle tissue (which contains lactic acid),
milk (in which lactic acid may be formed by bacteria), or
Mg + acid, in forming luciferin, is not the result of their
reducing power but of their acidity. Fortunately we can
test this matter by the use of reducing fluids which are not
acid. If they also form luciferin from oxyluciferin, a
reduction must occur. Nascent H can be generated by
the action of NaOH on Al, or when finely divided Mg or Zn<!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
or Al is placed in water. With Mg the water becomes
only slightly alkaline from formation of almost insoluble
Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>. If we add some Al powder and dilute NaOH
to an oxyluciferin solution, H is given off and luciferin
is formed. As oxyluciferin cannot be formed by the addition
of alkali alone we must have in this experiment a
reduction of oxyluciferin in alkaline medium by the nascent
H produced. Luciferin can also be formed by merely
adding Al or Zn or Mg dust to an oxyluciferin solution.
Methylene blue can also be readily reduced to its leuco-base
by Zn dust or Al + NaOH.</p>

<p>Indeed, if one adds some Al or Zn or Mg powder to a
solution of luciferase, light will appear whenever the solution
is shaken. Luciferase solution must always contain
the oxidation product of luciferin, oxyluciferin. In presence
of nascent H this is reduced to luciferin, and since
the reaction of the medium is alkaline and luciferase is
present this is oxidized with light production, when, by
shaking, air is dissolved. The light can never become
very bright except at the surface because of the deficiency
of oxygen in the solution. It would seem, then, that the
action of bacteria, yeast, muscle cells, etc., on oxyluciferin
must be due not entirely to their acid reaction but to
their reducing power as well.</p>

<p>The above experiment is a very striking and instructive
one. Given a test tube of luciferase solution containing,
as it does, oxyluciferin, add some Zn dust or Mg powder,
and the evolution of hydrogen begins. Conditions are now
favorable for the reduction of oxyluciferin and this occurs.
Shake the contents of the tube to dissolve oxygen and light
appears. Allow the tube to stand and the light soon disappears.
Shake again and the light reappears. The lumi<!-- Page 135 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>nescence
reduction and oxidation process can be demonstrated
many times.</p>

<p>A similar experiment can be performed with luciferase
and oxyluciferin solution by addition of NH<sub>4</sub>SH. This will
serve also as another example of the reduction of oxyluciferin
in an alkaline medium. Whenever we shake a tube
of luciferase, oxyluciferin and NH<sub>4</sub>SH, light will appear.
When the tube is at rest it becomes dark. Even the merest
touch is sufficient to agitate the tube contents, cause solution
of oxygen and appearance of light. It is just as if we
stimulate the tube to produce light and I believe the phenomenon
has a deeper significance and a more fundamental
similarity to the phenomena of stimulation than may
at first appear. What more simple means of controlling
a process can we think of than by admission or withdrawal
of oxygen? The firefly turns on its light by
stimulation through nerves of the luminous organ. <i>Noctiluca</i>
flashes on stimulation of any kind, even the slightest
agitation causing a brilliant emission of light. If the
stimulation process means merely the admission of oxygen
to the photogenic cells we have a mechanism in the cell
itself for automatically producing the light. The admission
of oxygen results in a&#0235;robic conditions and luciferin in
presence of luciferase can then oxidize to oxyluciferin with
luminescence. When the oxygen is used up, the light
ceases, ana&#0235;robic conditions prevail, and the oxyluciferin
is reduced to luciferin again. Thus, luciferin is reformed
during the rest period of <i>Noctiluca</i> or between the flashes
of the firefly. What more efficient type of light than this
is to be desired?</p>

<p>Again, methylene blue offers an interesting parallel to
<!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>oxyluciferin. A little NH<sub>4</sub>SH added to methylene blue
solution will reduce (decolorize) it to the leuco-base. If
the tube is now shaken the blue color returns. On standing
reduction again occurs. The process can be repeated a
number of times, the reaction going in one or the other
direction, depending on the oxygen content of the mixture.</p>

<p>As methylene blue contains no oxygen, its reduction
consists in the addition of two atoms of hydrogen. When
leuco-methylene blue oxidizes, water is formed by the
union of these two atoms of hydrogen with oxygen, thus:</p>

<p class="center">
C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>20</sub>N<sub>3</sub>SCl + O <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>18</sub>N<sub>3</sub>SCl + H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
(leuco-methylene blue) &emsp;&emsp; (methylene blue)<br />
<br />
Briefly&mdash;MH<sub>2</sub> + O <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> M + H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
</p>

<p>To reduce methylene blue we can add the two hydrogen
atoms directly from nascent hydrogen formed in the solution
or we can split up water by a catalyzer in the presence
of some substance, which will take up the oxygen of
water, thus:</p>

<p class="center">
NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Pd = NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + Pd<br />
(Sodium hypophosphite)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; (Sodium phosphite)
</p>

<p>This reaction occurs in presence of finely divided
palladium. Methylene blue can be reduced by the H<sub>2</sub>
and the hypophosphite oxidized.</p>

<p>Since oxyluciferin can be reduced by palladium and
sodium hypophosphite (Harvey, 1918), it is probable that
we can write the equation for reduction of oxyluciferin and
oxidation of luciferin in a similar manner to that of
methylene blue:</p>

<p class="center">
Luciferin + O <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> Oxyluciferin + H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
<br />
Briefly&mdash;LH<sub>2</sub> + O <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> L + H<sub>2</sub>O.<br />
</p>

<p>Just as in the case of methylene blue the reaction proceeds
in the right hand direction spontaneously if the<!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
pressure of O is sufficiently high. If luciferase is also
present we have luminescence.</p>

<p class="center">
LH<sub>2</sub> + O + luciferase <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> L + H<sub>2</sub>O + luciferase (luminescence)<br />
</p>

<p>The reaction proceeds in the left hand direction under
low oxygen pressure, in the presence of nascent hydrogen
or with some catalyzer which is able to split water, transferring
the H<sub>2</sub> to oxyluciferin and the O to an acceptor (A).
NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub> plays the part of the acceptor.</p>

<p class="center">
L + H<sub>2</sub>O + A + Pd = LH<sub>2</sub> + AO + Pd.<br />
</p>

<p>This appears to be the way in which the reducing
enzymes or perhydridases (comparable to the Pd) of living
tissues act (Bach, 1911-13) and the action of yeast
cells, bacteria, muscle suspensions, etc., in reducing oxyluciferin
must occur in the same manner.</p>

<p>If we assume that the LH<sub>2</sub> (luciferin) compound is dissociated
to even the slightest extent into L and hydrogen,
the hydrogen ion will shift the equilibrium toward the
formation of that substance which involves the taking up
of hydrogen. Consequently we may obtain a partial formation
of luciferin by adding an acid to oxyluciferin. Reduction
of the H-ion concentration tends to shift the
equilibrium in the opposite direction. Consequently,
addition of alkali favors the oxidation of luciferin, and it
is quite generally true that biological oxidations are
favored by an alkaline reaction. In addition oxygen in
alkaline medium has a higher oxidation potential than in
neutral or acid media. I believe this is the explanation
of the action of acid in formation of luciferin
from oxyluciferin.</p>

<p>Addition of acid is not the only means of favoring
the formation of luciferin from oxyluciferin. Any reac<!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>tion
which proceeds in one direction with evolution of
light should, theoretically, proceed in the opposite direction
under the influence of light. So far as I know
the case of a reaction, photogenic in one direction and
photochemical in the other direction, has never been described,
unless we are to accept the cases of phosphorescence,
for instance, the absorption of light by CaS and its
emission in the dark. However, the reaction which occurs
during phosphorescence cannot be stated.</p>

<p>It is a fact that light will cause the reduction of oxyluciferin.
A tube of oxyluciferin exposed to sunlight for
six hours, or the mercury arc for two hours, will be
partially converted into luciferin. It will luminesce when
luciferase is added, while a control tube kept in darkness
shows no trace of luciferin. The action is more marked
with the ultra-violet as a solution of oxyluciferin in a
quartz tube showed more reduction than one in a glass
tube when exposed for the same length of time to the
quartz mercury arc. The reduction is not dependent on
the formation of acid under the influence of light since two
tubes of oxyluciferin, one kept in darkness and the other
exposed to sunlight for six hours, had the same reaction,
<span class="smcap">Ph</span> = 9.3. Of course some reducing substance might be
formed under the influence of light but this is not
very probable.</p>

<p>We may therefore write the reaction for luminescence
in the following way:</p>

<p>Acid and light favor reduction while alkali and darkness
favor oxidation in the luciferin <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> oxyluciferin reaction.
Whether the luciferin be really oxidized by removal
of H<sub>2</sub> or whether by addition of oxygen is, of course, uncertain,
but the analogy with methylene blue is striking and
may serve as a working hypothesis until the composition
of luciferin and its oxidation product are known.</p>

<p>While I have not studied the properties of oxyluciferin
as fully as those of luciferin, so far as I can judge, both
substances give the same general reactions and possess
identical properties. Both crude luciferin and crude
oxyluciferin solution are yellow in color, but I do not believe
that either pure luciferin or oxyluciferin are yellow
in color, because an ether or benzine extract of <i>Cypridina</i>
is also yellow, although luciferase, luciferin, and oxyluciferin
are insoluble in ether and benzine. The yellow pigment
which can be observed to make up part of the
luminous gland of <i>Cypridina</i> is not luciferin or luciferase.
It may be a pigment related to <i>urochrome</i>.</p>

<p>When tests are applied and precipitating reagents
are added to crude luciferin and crude oxyluciferin solution,
they give identical results in each case. A more
complete account of the chemistry of luciferin has been
given in this chapter, and there is no need of duplicating
these statements regarding oxyluciferin. Like luciferin,
the oxyluciferin will pass porcelain filters, dialyze
through parchment or collodion membranes, and is
undigested by salivary diastase, pepsin HCl, Merck's pancreatin
in neutral solution, and erepsin. The salivary
diastase and the pancreatin (containing amylopsin, trypsin,
and lipase) were allowed to digest for four days at
38&#0176; C. without showing any evidence of digestive action.<!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>As luciferin is so easily oxidizable a substance, we
should expect to find that it will reduce just as glucose
will reduce. However, a concentrated solution of luciferin
has no reducing action on Fehling's (alkaline Cu),
Barfoed's (acid Cu), Nylander's (alkaline Bi) or Knapp's
(alkaline Hg) reagent. Glucose will reduce methylene
blue in alkaline (not in neutral solution), but luciferin
will not reduce methylene blue in alkaline or neutral solution.
It would seem, then, that luciferin must contain
no aldehyde group. If so, we should expect to obtain
reduction of some of the above reagents. Just what group
is concerned in the oxidation is unknown at the present
time, and in the absence of more experimental data, speculation
regarding it can be of little value.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>In summing up we may say that the luminescence of
at least three groups of luminous animals, the beetles,
<i>Pholas</i>, and <i>Cypridina</i>, has been definitely shown to be
due to the interaction of two substances, luciferin and
luciferase, in presence of water and oxygen. Luciferin
and luciferase have quite different properties and may be
easily separated from each other by various chemical
procedures. As the luciferins and luciferases from different
luminous animals have somewhat different properties,
they may be designated by prefixing the generic name of
the animal from which they are obtained.</p>

<p><i>Cypridina</i> luciferin differs from <i>Pholas</i> luciferin in
that it can not be oxidized with light production by
KMnO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, with or without h&aelig;moglobin, or similar
oxidizing agents. <i>Cypridina</i> luciferase differs from
<i>Pholas</i> and firefly luciferase in that it is not readily<!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
destroyed by the fat-solvent an&aelig;sthetics, such as chloroform,
ether, etc.</p>

<p>When <i>Cypridina</i> luciferin is oxidized, no fundamental
splitting of the molecule occurs, because the product, oxyluciferin,
can be readily reduced to luciferin again. This
reduction is brought about under conditions similar to
those necessary for the reduction of dyes, such as methylene
blue. Oxyluciferin can be reduced to luciferin, which
will again give light with luciferase, by the reductases of
muscle tissue, liver, etc., or by bacteria; by Schardinger's
enzyme of milk; by H<sub>2</sub>S; by the nascent hydrogen from
the action of acetic acid on magnesium or of water or
NaOH on aluminium, zinc or magnesium; and by palladium
black and sodium hypophosphite, all well-known
reducing methods. Reduction of oxyluciferin no doubt
occurs even in presence of luciferase if oxygen is absent,
and reduction of oxyluciferin no doubt occurs in animals
which burn luciferin within the cell, thus tending for conservation
of material. Dilute alkali favors oxidation and
dilute acid favors the reduction. Light favors the reduction
of oxyluciferin.</p>

<p>Apparently luciferin and oxyluciferin have identical
chemical properties. Neither is digested by the enzymes:
malt diastase, ptyalin, yeast invertase, pepsin, trypsin,
steapsin, amylopsin, rennin, erepsin, urease or enzymes
occurring in the water extracts of dried spleen, kidney,
or liver. Luciferase is destroyed only by pepsin (probably),
trypsin, erepsin, and something in spleen and
liver extract.</p>

<p>Luciferase is unquestionably a protein and all its
properties agree with those of the albumins. Although
used up in oxidizing large quantities of luciferin,<!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
it behaves in many ways like an enzyme and may be
so regarded.</p>

<p>Luciferin, on the other hand, is not digested by proteolytic
enzymes, is dialyzable, almost but not completely
precipitated by saturation with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and is soluble
in absolute alcohol, acetone, and some other organic
solvents, but not in the strictly fat-solvents like ether,
chloroform, and benzol. There are, however, certain
CO-NH linkages which are not attacked by proteolytic
enzymes and some peptones soluble in absolute alcohol,
so that these two characteristics do not bar it from the
group of proteins. Luciferin, in fact, has many properties
in common with the proteoses and peptones but its
chemical nature cannot be definitely stated at present.<!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII
<br />
DYNAMICS OF LUMINESCENCE</h2>


<p>One of the most extraordinary things regarding luminescence
in general is the small amount of material necessary
to cause a visible emission of light. To take an extreme
case, the flash of light resulting from the impact on
ZnS of a single &#945; particle, a helium atom, is visible to
the naked eye. Addition of one part in a million of some
heavy metal to pure CaS will confer phosphorescent properties
on the latter. We are forced to believe that the
heavy metal enters into some reaction during illumination
which is reversed with light emission after illumination
and a very small amount of heavy metal is necessary.
Pyrogallol in water, 1:5,000,000 (m/512,000), can be oxidized
with light production by K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
(Harvey, 1917) and m/100 pyrogallol + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will give a
visible light with colloidal platinum in 1:250,000 concentration
(Goss, 1917).</p>

<p>Luciferin and luciferase from <i>Cypridina</i> will also luminesce
in exceedingly small concentration. If one grinds
a single <i>Cypridina</i> in a mortar with water and dilutes the
extract to 25,600 c.c., light can be observed if luciferin is
added to this dilute luciferase solution. By determining
the volume of the luminous gland of <i>Cypridina</i> and even
assuming that this volume is all luciferase, one can calculate
that one part of luciferase in 1,700,000,000 parts of
water will give light when luciferin is added. Likewise,
a similar dilution of luciferin will give visible light when
luciferase is added.<!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>The sensitivity of our eye is largely responsible for
the detection of so small an energy change. As we have
seen, recent determinations have proved that the dark
adapted eye can detect 18 &#0215; 10<sup>-10</sup> ergs per second. From
the heat of complete oxidation of pyrogallol it is
possible to calculate the amount of pyrogallol necessary
to give 18 &#0215; 10<sup>-10</sup> ergs if completely oxidized. This
quantity is infinitesimally small. When pyrogallol is
oxidized by K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, it is not completely
oxidized and probably only a small amount of the energy
is converted into light; otherwise we should be able to see
the luminescence of a very much weaker concentration
of pyrogallol. As the reaction luciferin <span class="unifont" title="[left arrow over right arrow]">&#x21C6;</span> oxyluciferin
is so easily reversible, very little energy must be liberated,
and, as experiments indicate, very little heat, if any, accompanies
light production. Even though this be true, it is
still possible for a very small amount of luciferin to produce
a very large amount of light.</p>

<p>A very small amount of luciferase only is necessary because
it behaves as an enzyme and follows the general rule
that catalysts act in minute concentrations.</p>

<p>On the assumption that luciferase is an enzyme, an
organic catalyst oxidizing luciferin with light production,
we may appropriately inquire into the relation between the
concentration of luciferin and luciferase and intensity
and duration of luminescence. Oxygen tension, hydrogen
ion concentration and temperature must be maintained
constant as these all affect both intensity and duration of
luminescence. Before considering luciferin and luciferase,
however, let us study a few well-known chemiluminescent
oxidations with special reference to concentration
of reacting substances and temperature.<!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The effect of temperature on luminescence is of special
interest because it gives us a means of analysis for determining
if the luminescence depends on reaction velocity.
We know that photochemical reactions are very little
affected by temperature because the reaction is dependent
on the absorption of light, a physical process, and this
increases only a small per cent. for a rise of temperature
of 10&#0176; C. To put it in the usual way, its temperature
coefficient (Q<sub>10</sub>) for a 10&#0176; interval is usually less than 1.1.
On the other hand, we should expect photogenic reactions,
in which some of the chemical energy is converted into
radiant energy, to give off much more light the
greater the reaction velocity. As reaction velocity increases
so rapidly with temperature (Q<sub>10</sub> = 2 to 3),
luminescence intensity should rapidly increase with
increase in temperature.</p>

<p>Trautz (1905), from his extensive study of the chemiluminescence
of phenol and aldehyde compounds came to
the conclusion that luminescence intensity was proportional
to reaction velocity. He based his conclusions
largely on the effects of temperature and concentration of
reacting substances and went so far as to declare that any
reaction would produce luminescence if the reaction velocity
were sufficiently increased. It is quite true that increasing
the temperature does increase the intensity of chemiluminescence,
but this is only within certain limits. As
we raise the temperature, chemiluminescence becomes
more intense but we soon reach a temperature for maximum
luminescence and above this the intensity diminishes.
This is especially well seen in the action of various
oxidizers on pyrogallol and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> recorded in <a href="#TABLE_10">Table 10</a>.
At 100&#0176; C. practically no light is produced by many<!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
oxidizers which are themselves unaffected at 100&#0176;. If we
are to connect reaction velocity with intensity of luminescence
we must conclude that the evolution of light is
dependent rather on an optimum than a maximum reaction
velocity.</p>

<p>Quite a number of instances are known in which increasing
the mass of reacting substances leads not to an
increase but to an actual cessation of luminescence. This
fact does not confirm the theory that reaction velocity is
a determining factor in luminescence. The conditions for
the luminescence of white phosphorus are most interesting
and unusual. (See van't Hoff, 1895; Ewan, 1895; Centnerszwer,
1895; Russell,1903; Scharff, 1908.) Phosphorus will
only begin to luminesce at a certain small pressure of
oxygen. This "minimum luminescence pressure" of oxygen
is very low, so low that earlier observers, failing to
remove traces of oxygen, thought that luminescence might
occur in absence of oxygen. Curiously enough there is also
a "maximum luminescence pressure" of oxygen above
which no luminescence occurs. Phosphorus will not luminesce
in pure oxygen. Between the minimum and maximum
is an "optimum luminescence pressure" where
luminescence of the phosphorus is brightest. The exact
values of these pressures vary with degree of water vapor
present and with temperature. According to Abegg's
<i>Handbuch der anorganischen Chemie</i>, the maximum luminescence
pressure with water vapor present, is 320 mm.
Hg at 0&#0176; and increases 13.19 mm. Hg for each degree rise
in temperature. This means that for a definite temperature,
say, 20&#0176;, phosphorus will not luminesce with an oxygen
pressure of 583 mm. Hg, but will luminesce with
pressures under this. If, however, we raise the tempera<!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ture,
luminescence will occur with an oxygen pressure
of 583 mm. Hg.</p>

<p>A somewhat analogous case is presented by the oxidation
of pyrogallol solution in contact with ozone, except
that in this reaction too high a concentration of pyrogallol
will hinder the oxidation. I have not studied the effect of
varying concentrations of ozone. If oxygen, passed
through an ozonizer (the silent electric discharge tube), is
bubbled through m/100 pyrogallol, no luminescence occurs
at 0&#0176;, a fair luminescence at 20&#0176;, a good luminescence at
50&#0176;, and a bright luminescence at the boiling point. If
the pyrogallol is of <i>m</i> concentration, no luminescence
occurs at 0&#0176; or 20&#0176;, a fair luminescence at 50&#0176;, and a bright
luminescence at the boiling point. For a definite temperature,
say 20&#0176;, no light appears if the pyrogallol is of
<i>m</i> concentration, but if we raise the temperature, luminescence
can occur. The similarity to phosphorus is
obvious. Thus the "maximum luminescence pressure"
of pyrogallol increases with increase of temperature.</p>

<p>We have already seen that pyrogallol can also be oxidized,
if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is present, by a great variety of substances,
such as peroxidases of potato or turnip juice, h&aelig;moglobin,
KMnO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>, CrO<sub>3</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, hypochlorites and
hypobromites, or colloidal Pt and Ag. For convenience
we may collectively speak of these as oxidizers. They are
recorded in <a href="#Table_13">Table 13</a>. No light occurs if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>is absent.
In the case of some of these oxidizers pyrogallol will
luminesce in dilute concentrations but not in strong.
Also, dilute pyrogallol will luminesce with a dilute solution
of oxidizer but not with a concentrated solution of
oxidizer. The effect of rise in temperature in these cases
also is to increase the "maximum luminescence concen<!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>tration"
of pyrogallol and the "maximum luminescence
concentration" of oxidizer. <a href="#TABLE_11">Table 11</a> shows this effect
of temperature with K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> and varying concentrations
of pyrogallol, and <a href="#TABLE_12">Table 12</a> shows the effect of temperature
with pyrogallol and varying concentrations of
K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>. <a href="#TABLE_10">Table 10</a> shows the relation between temperature
and intensity of luminescence with pyrogallol
and various oxidizers. The terms <i>faint</i>, <i>fair</i>, <i>good</i>, and
<i>bright</i> are purely relative designations of brightness as
estimated by the eye, for accurate measurements of weak
intensities are very difficult to make.</p>

<p>From <a href="#TABLE_10">Table 10</a> it should be noted that the intensity of
luminescence of pyrogallol oxidized with most oxidizers is
actually less at the boiling point, a fact which I have repeatedly
verified. Let us now see how these facts are to
be explained. If we assume that luminescence is dependent
on reaction velocity, the intensity of luminescence
should increase with increasing temperature. Up to a
certain limit this is what we find, but at temperatures
above this limit the intensity of luminescence actually
decreases. The duration of luminescence also decreases.
There is an optimum temperature for luminescence in
many cases and we can only conclude that luminescence
depends not on a very rapid reaction velocity but on a
certain definite reaction velocity. Assuming that this is
true, how can we account for the anomalous fact that in
high concentrations of oxygen, phosphorus will not luminesce
or that in high concentrations of pyrogallol, there is
no luminescence in presence of ozone or of oxidizer and
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Of course with high active mass of oxygen (in case
of phosphorous luminescence) or of pyrogallol (in case of
pyrogallol luminescence) the reaction velocity must be<!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
greater than the optimum. If that is the case, then lowering
the temperature should reduce the reaction velocity
to the optimum and light should appear. However, as we
have seen, not lowering but raising the temperature causes
luminescence with high oxygen concentration or high pyrogallol
concentration.</p>

I believe the explanation of these phenomena lies
rather in another direction and that the effect of the temperature
and concentration of reacting substances affects
not only the reaction velocity but also the reaction products.
While intensity of luminescence undoubtedly increases
with increasing reaction velocity, the luminescence
itself probably accompanies only one stage in the formation
of a series of oxidation products. This stage is
favored at a definite temperature and mass of reacting
substances. Thus, in the oxidation of phosphorus several
intermediate oxides are said to be formed. The oxidation
takes place in steps and probably the luminescence is
connected with only one of the steps in a chain of reactions.
It is probable that a certain oxygen pressure and
temperature favors that particular step at the expense
of the others and so this oxygen concentration and temperature
correspond to the optimum for luminescence.</p>

<p>The supposition that certain definite oxidation products
of pyrogallol must be formed in order to produce
light is borne out by the fact that pyrogallol must be
oxidized in a particular way to obtain luminescence. The
blackening of pyrogallol with absorption of oxygen in
presence of alkali is a very well-known reaction, but
luminescence does not accompany this type of oxidation.
I have tried mixing all concentrations of pyrogallol and
all concentrations of alkali in an endeavor to obtain some<!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
light, but always with negative results. Likewise my
attempts to obtain light during the electrolysis of salt solutions
containing pyrogallol by means of the nascent oxygen
at various kinds of anodes have met with negative
results. A similar case is presented by luciferin which
oxidizes spontaneously (most rapidly in presence of
alkali) without light production and only produces light
when oxidized in presence of luciferase.</p>

<p>To sum up the results of the dynamics of chemiluminescence
we may say that certain oxyluminescences occur
only if the substance is oxidized in a particular way under
definite conditions of temperature and concentration and
that this is probably due to a favoring of one step (with
which the luminescence is associated) in a chain of oxidations.
Providing temperature and concentration are
such as to favor the step responsible for luminescence, then
higher temperature and greater concentration result in
increased intensity of luminescence.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to luminous organisms and consider
the effect of temperature and of concentration of reacting
substances (oxygen, luciferin and luciferase) on the luminescence.
We have already seen that luminescence of a
luciferin-luciferase mixture begins with an extraordinarily
low oxygen tension and increases in intensity with increasing
tension of oxygen, but that very soon an oxygen
tension is reached where a maximum luminescence is obtained
and further increase of oxygen tension gives no
brighter light. In this respect the luminescence intensity&mdash;oxygen
tension curve is no doubt very similar to the
h&aelig;moglobin saturation&mdash;oxygen tension curve. H&aelig;moglobin
is about 50 per cent. saturated at 10 mm. oxygen
pressure, 80 per cent. saturated at 20 mm. oxygen pressure<!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
and completely saturated at pressures of oxygen well below
the pressure of oxygen in air (152 mm. Hg). As the
optimum oxygen tension for luminescence of luciferin is
also well below that of air, mixtures of luciferin and luciferase
luminesce with equal brilliancy whether air or pure
oxygen is bubbled through them. To obtain an excess of
oxygen it is only necessary to keep the solution saturated
with air and statements regarding concentration of luciferin
and luciferase and intensity or duration refer to
excess of oxygen. Investigators who have studied the
effect of increase in oxygen pressure on luminous animals
have come to the same conclusions. High pressures of
air or oxygen do not increase the intensity of luminescence
(Dubois and Regnard, 1884).</p>

<p>The hydrogen ion concentration of crude solutions of
luciferin and luciferase, made by extracting whole Cypridinas
with hot or cold water is fairly constant, about
<span class="smcap">Ph</span> = 9, determined electrometrically. Such solutions
have a high buffer value and the <span class="smcap">Ph</span> does not change
during oxidation of luciferin so that this variable is automatically
controlled.</p>

<p>Because of difficulties in measuring low intensities of
light which are constantly changing, no figures on light
intensities can be given, but it is easy to establish the following
facts: The greater the concentration of luciferin
or luciferase the more intense the luminescence. The
greater the concentration of luciferin the longer the duration
of luminescence and the greater the concentration of
luciferase, the shorter the luminescence lasts. Thus, if we
mix concentrated luciferin and weak luciferase we get a
bright light which lasts for a half hour or more, gradually
growing more dim. Concentrated luciferase and weak<!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
luciferin give a bright flash of light which disappears
almost instantly. Concentrated luciferase and concentrated
luciferin give a brilliant light which lasts for an
intermediate length of time and weak luciferin and weak
luciferase give a faint luminescence which lasts for an
intermediate length of time.</p>

<p>These facts can all be explained by regarding luciferase
as a catalyzer which accelerates the oxidation of luciferin
and by assuming that intensity of luminescence is
dependent on reaction velocity, <i>i.e.</i>, on rate of oxidation.
Contrary to the condition for phosphorus and for pyrogallol
there appears to be no optimum concentration of
luciferase or luciferin, but the luminescence intensity
increases gradually with increasing concentration of luminous
substances up to the point where pure (?) luciferin
and pure (?) luciferase, as secreted from the gland cells
of the animal, come in contact with each other. This, the
maximum brightness, is not to be compared with the light
of an incandescent solid, but is nevertheless visible in a
well-lighted room, out of direct sunlight.</p>

<p>The effect of temperature on <i>Cypridina</i> luminescence
also bears out the preceding conclusions. For a given
mixture of luciferin and luciferase the light becomes more
intense with increasing temperature up to a definite optimum
and then diminishes in intensity. The diminution
in intensity above the optimum is due to a reversible
change in the luciferase so that its active mass diminishes.
This change becomes irreversible in the neighborhood of
70&#0176; (depending on various conditions), where coagulation
of luciferase occurs. Light will appear at 0&#0176; but it is far
less intense than light at higher temperatures and it is
more yellow in color. The light of optimum temperatures<!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
is quite blue. The weaker light at temperatures above the
optimum is also more yellow in color. I believe this difference
in color is a function of the slowed reaction velocity,
for a mixture of luciferin and luciferase which gives
a bluish luminescence at room temperature, will give a
weaker and yellowish luminescence if diluted with water.
Dilution with water will slow the reaction velocity. If the
difference in color were not real but due to change in color
sensitivity of the eye with different intensities of such
relatively weak light (Purkinje phenomenon), the weaker
light should appear more blue. As the weaker light
appears more yellow, I therefore believe the color difference
is actual and not subjective.</p>

<p>A minimum, optimum, and maximum temperature for
luminescence is observed in all luminous organisms. The
minimum is usually very low. Luminous bacteria will still
light at -11.5&#0176; C. The power to luminesce under ordinary
conditions is not destroyed by exposure to liquid air, for,
on raising the temperature, light again appears (Macfayden,
1900, 1902). Almost all organisms will luminesce
at 0&#0176; C., and the luminescence minimum probably represents
the point at which complete freezing of the luminous
solution occurs. It is very low with bacteria because they
are solutions in capillary spaces of very small size, a
condition tending to lower the freezing point.</p>

<p>The luminescence maximum represents the point at
which luciferase is reversibly changed so as to be no
longer active. If the temperature is again lowered the
luciferase again becomes active and light reappears.
Some degrees above this, and in all forms well below the
boiling point, luciferase is coagulated and destroyed.
As the coagulation point of proteins depends on many<!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
factors, such as time of heating, salt content, acidity, etc.,
so the luciferases of different animals coagulate at different
temperatures depending on these conditions. Some of the
more reliable observations on these critical temperatures
are collected in <a href="#Table_14">Table 14</a>.</p>

<p>We are thus led to the conclusion that intensity of
luminescence is dependent on the velocity of oxidation of
luciferin and that with lowered reaction velocity the spectral
composition of the light changes. The maximum
emission shifts toward the yellow. I believe, however,
that in <i>Cypridina</i> also, the luminescence intensity depends
not only on reaction velocity but on the particular manner
in which luciferin is oxidized. <i>Cypridina</i> luciferin will
luminesce only in presence of <i>Cypridina</i> luciferase and no
light can be obtained from <i>Cypridina</i> luciferin and a
host of different oxidizers (with or without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) such
as are able to oxidize pyrogallol. Luciferin will also
oxidize in the air spontaneously but no light is produced.
It is easy to show that this spontaneous oxidation
may be much more rapid than an oxidation with
luciferase and yet light appears only in presence of the
latter. If a concentrated solution of luciferin is kept
near the boiling point it will be completely oxidized to
oxyluciferin in four or five minutes. No light appears if
air or even if pure oxygen is bubbled through it. The
same solution kept at 20&#0176; with a small amount of luciferase
will luminesce continuously and not be completely oxidized
to oxyluciferin in a half hour. We can, however, cause the
luciferin to oxidize as rapidly at 20&#0176; by adding concentrated
luciferase as does the luciferin near the boiling
point without luciferase. A bright light is produced in the
former case, none in the latter case. The oxyluciferin<!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
formed from spontaneous oxidation of luciferin appears to
be the same as that formed with luciferase present. Both
give luciferin again on reduction. Perhaps the reaction
takes place in two stages, similar to those supposed to
occur in other enzyme actions:</p>

<p class="center">luciferin + luciferase = luciferinluciferase</p>
<p class="center">luciferinluciferase + O (or minus H<sub>2</sub>) = oxyluciferin + luciferase.</p>

<p>We may then assume as a tentative hypothesis that
luminescence only occurs during oxidation (addition of
O or removal of H) of the luciferinluciferase compound.</p>

<p>We have just seen that the effect of cooling a <i>Cypridina</i>
extract containing luciferin and luciferase and luminescing
with a bluish light, is to reduce the intensity and
change the shade toward the yellow. Velocity of oxidation
must be lowered and with the same concentration of luciferase
lowered velocity means more light of the longer
wave-lengths. A very instructive experiment on color of
the light can be carried out with animals having different
colored lights and so closely related that their luciferins
and luciferases will interact with each other. Such a case
is presented by the American fireflies, <i>Photinus</i> and <i>Photuris</i>.
<i>Photinus</i> emits an orange light, while <i>Photuris</i>
emits a greenish yellow light. The difference in color is
especially noticeable when the luminous organs of the two
forms are ground up in separate mortars. As shown by
Coblentz, the difference in color is real, the spectrum
of <i>Photinus</i> extending farther into the red than that of
<i>Photuris</i> (see <a href="#FIG_8">Fig. 8</a>). We can easily prepare luciferin
and luciferase from the two fireflies and make the following
mixtures:<!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Photinus</i> luciferin &#0215; <i>Photinus</i> luciferase = reddish
light.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Photinus</i> luciferin &#0215; <i>Photuris</i> luciferase = yellowish
light.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Photuris</i> luciferin &#0215; <i>Photuris</i> luciferase = yellowish
light.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Photuris</i> luciferin &#0215; <i>Photinus</i> luciferase = reddish
light.</p>

<p>Thus the color of the light in these "crosses" is that
characteristic of the animal supplying the luciferase. To
bring this fact in line with what we have already said
regarding reaction velocity and luminescence, we must
believe that the <i>Photinus</i> luciferase oxidizes at a slower
rate than the <i>Photuris</i> luciferase. In this connection it is
of interest to recall that the <i>Photuris</i> light as emitted by
the insect becomes reddish at high temperatures, or if the
insect is plunged into alcohol, both conditions which bring
about partial coagulation of the luciferase and reduce its
active mass.<!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="Transcribers_Notes" id="Transcribers_Notes"></a>Transcriber's Notes</h3>

<p>Uncommon forms for chemical names have been retained where they occur in
the text, e.g. "atropin" for "atropine"; "asparagin" for "asparagine",
etc.</p>

<p>The spellings of "Sidot blend" and "Sidot blende" are used interchangeably.</p>

<p>"P<span class="smcap">H</span>" or P<sub>H</sub> (subscript H) is used throughout for the scale of alkali-acidity where the modern usage is "pH".</p>

<p>On page 173, the citation for <span class="smcap">Nutting, P. G.</span>: 1908 has page range pp.
261-039. This is as it appears in the original, but is probably in error.</p>

<p>Minor corrections to formatting and missing punctuation (mostly in the
bibliography) have been changed without an explicit note.</p>
